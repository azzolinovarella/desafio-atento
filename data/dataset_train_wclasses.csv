judging from previous posts this used to be a good place but not any longer,0
we there were four of us arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude,0
they never brought us complimentary noodles ignored repeated requests for sugar and threw our dishes on the table,0
the food was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny,0
after all that they complained to me about the small tip,0
avoid this place,0
i have eaten at saul many times the food is always consistently outrageously good,2
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn,2
the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world,2
the wine list is interesting and has many good values,2
for the price you can not eat this well in manhattan,0
i was very disappointed with this restaurant,0
ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away,1
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested,1
food was okay nothing great,1
chow fun was dry pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family,0
i we will never go back to this place again,0
went on a 3 day oyster binge with fish bringing up the closing and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended because it was so great,2
service was devine oysters where a sensual as they come and the price ca n t be beat,1
you ca n t go wrong here,1
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street,2
everything is always cooked to perfection the service is excellent the decor cool and understated,2
i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible,2
and i hate to say this but i doubt i ll ever go back,0
the food is very average the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet every thing they serve is too sweet here,0
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree,2
i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty could ve used a bit more salt,2
the decor is night tho but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling its quite un appetizing and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern,0
we went around 9 30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great,2
the perfect spot,2
food awesome,2
service friendly and attentive,2
ambiance relaxed and stylish,2
do n t judge this place prima facie you have to try it to believe it a home away from home for the literate heart,1
the food is decent,2
however it s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth,0
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self respect which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me i e make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water or the check,1
i know you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored but my agenda is i m here to eat and enjoy the company of friends seeking a pleasant experience,2
well i did n t find it there and trust i have told everyone i can think of about my experience,1
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty hmmm,1
i had a great experience,2
food is great,2
service is top notch,2
i have been going back again and again,1
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency not too fishy creamy and slightly buttery,2
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned,2
the rice to fish ration was also good they did n t try to overpack the rice,2
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it,2
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth,1
in the evening this place attracted a well dressed with it ny crowd,2
the food was well prepared and the service impecable,2
i m going back,1
quite simply it s like stepping out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquility,2
i will be going back and heartily recommend it,2
it is terrific as is the value,2
6 and there is much tasty food all of it fresh and continually refilled,2
i am not a vegetarian but almost all the dishes were great,2
go hungry and enjoy,2
i like the somosas chai and the chole but the dhosas and dhal were kinda disappointing,0
the service varys from day to day sometimes they re very nice and sometimes not,2
the kitchen however is almost always slow,0
if you ve ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer,1
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening,2
the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it,2
once you step into cosette you re miraculously in a small off the beaten path parisian bistro,2
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets with that certain parisian flair,2
the food was average to above average the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive and the desserts not brilliant in any way,0
however go for the ambience and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world,1
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n t even fully melted,0
it looked like shredded cheese partly done still in strips,1
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn,0
the pizza is overpriced and soggy,0
yes they use fancy ingredients but even fancy ingredients do n t make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right,0
a big disappointment all around,0
i think i ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow,2
the seafood is amazing there s a good wine list and the ever changing menu always offers some great surprises,2
the combination of super fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious,2
worth the trip from manhattan,1
best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous,2
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it,2
as a japanese native i ve lived in the tristate area for over 8 years but i was just so amazed at this place,2
this place is the most japanese it can ever get,1
the signs the specials menus food and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese,1
this place is worth an one hour drive,2
i am so coming back here again as much as i can,2
leon is an east village gem casual but hip with well prepared basic french bistro fare good specials a warm and lively atmosphere,2
my wife and i always enjoy the young not always well trained but nevertheless friendly staff all of whom have a story,2
decent wine at reasonable prices,2
our teenage kids love it too,2
everytime i decide to try another place on the ues i get angry that i did n t just go to zucchero pomodori,0
this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood,2
the service is excellent the decor is great and the food is delicious and comes in large portions,2
i m partial to the gnocchi,1
this place is incredibly tiny,0
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends,0
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive,0
the food was bland oily,0
i just do n t understand all the hype,0
we have been to this place many times and always have great food wine and service,2
we were worried we would have trouble getting in but somehow managed to have a short wait,1
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited,2
when we sat we got great and fast service,2
the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes,2
this is a fun restaurant to go to,2
the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere,2
but the pizza is way to expensive,0
a large is 20 and toppings are about 3 each,1
i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read,0
sauce was watery and the food did n t have much flavor,0
i do n t think i would go again,0
this place is great,2
the waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal,2
service was prompt friendly and great,2
slightly on the pricey side but worth it,2
great pizza and fantastic service,2
there was a small wait but shorter than i expected,1
located at the end of a magnificent block,2
very cozy and warm inside,2
i will be back,2
this is the best sushi in new york city hands down,2
the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic,2
planet thailand has always been a hit with me i go there usually for the sushi which is great the thai food is excellent too,2
with the great variety on the menu i eat here often and never get bored,2
the atmosphere is n t the greatest but i suppose that s how they keep the prices down,1
it s all about the food,1
first it took us a long time to find the place,0
but when we looked at the menu there were n t a lot of choices most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section,1
those rolls were big but not good and sashimi was n t fresh,0
they were dry and disgusting i did n t even finish my first piece,0
hurley s is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came,2
try the crunchy tuna it is to die for,1
try everything for that matter it is all good,2
i have been going there since it opened and i ca n t get enough,1
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace,2
the food was amazing and the service was prompt and helpful but not over bearing or rushed,2
the steak tartare is a great bet they fix it for you at the table,2
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm but the open kitchen is part of the charm,2
great wine selection gigondas is worth the price and the house champagne is a great value,2
it may be a bit packed on weekends but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area,2
have recommended the place to friends always gets good response,2
pizza the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings the crust tastes like the best freshly baked bread,2
i take all my nyc guests to vt s,1
not sure where the previous reviewer lonk dined but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food,2
i ve been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences,2
i d highly recommend it for a special occasion it provides and intimate setting and nice service,2
i m not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and i all enjoy mizu very much and we re repeat customers,2
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there,0
it s delicious,2
moules were excellent lobster ravioli was very salty,2
took my mom for mother s day and the maitre d was pretty rude,0
told us to sit anywhere and when we sat he said the table was reserved,1
stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting,1
tiny dessert was 8 00 just plain overpriced for what it is,0
the drinks are always well made and wine selection is fairly priced,2
try their chef s specials they are to die for,0
service is not exactly five star but thats not really a big deal,1
downstairs lounge is always a good attraction,2
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations,2
it is also extremely well priced,2
the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive,2
the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines,2
this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed,2
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem,2
when we stumbled on leon we thought that we had found quite the gem but we were certainly wrong,1
the waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet we were told no,0
then to top things off she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend s jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes,0
such a disappointment,0
rude service medicore food there are tons of restaurants in ny stay away from this one,0
i loved everythig about it especially the shows and actors,2
our server was very helpful and friendly,2
the food was good too,2
the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent,2
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful,2
inside is a little cramped but to be expected,1
service was prompt and courteous,2
this was a repeat visit and we ll definitely be back again,2
great service great food,2
prices are in line,1
but too far east,1
the pizza is delicious they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap frozen shredded cheese common to most pizzaria s,2
two complaints their appetizer selection stinks it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu,0
also because it is so thin it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling,0
wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws,2
by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant,2
over 100 different choices to create your own,1
a must try,1
on a recent sunday afternoon a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt,2
this was the perfect quiet relaxing and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater,2
the chicken pot pie is exceptional the cheeseburger huge and delictable and the service professional wan warm,2
with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district is truly an excellent find,2
the staff is no nonsense,1
when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else,2
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store,2
he served me an uni hand roll which i never had before and let me tell you it was heaven,2
the sake menu should not be overlooked,1
all in all this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city,2
try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll,1
service was very good prompt attentive and non intrusive,2
food was very good as well considering that we tried the budget selection though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience,2
wine list selection is good and wine by the glass was generously filled to the top,2
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation,1
i ve been to at cafe spice probably 5 8 times it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square,2
to sum it up service varies from good to mediorce depending on which waiter you get generally it is just average ok,0
seating is always prompt though the restaurant does fill up in the evening,2
food is usually very good though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders,2
as many other reviewers noticed your order is often slow to arrive this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time,1
the decor is vibrant and eye pleasing with several semi private boths on the right side of the dining hall which are great for a date,2
i have never been disappointed in the red eye,2
the first time i went and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere i ordered the lobster cobb salad,1
it s simply the best meal in nyc,2
you can not go wrong at the red eye grill,2
if we were to move from the upper east side we would genuinely miss this restaurant,0
the restaurant is cute but not upscale,1
the food is a diamond in rough the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes,2
i would highly recommend it,2
it s one of our favorite places to eat in ny,2
we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night,2
after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner,2
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile,2
the place s decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh,2
i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks,2
if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained this is a great place to go and eat,2
the have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini,2
the entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner,2
you will not be disapointed at all,1
we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem,2
the bagel was huge,2
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese gets a little messy,0
i loved it and would highly recommend,2
this was my frist time at cafe st bart s and i must say how delicious the food and the service was,2
i have to highly recommend the lobster roll not to much mayo you can tell it was a fresh lobster,2
other guests enjoyed pizza santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips,2
i highly recommend cafe st bart s for their food the ambience and wonderful service,2
all the staff is absolutely professional,2
that is a must but not every restaurant can do,1
there s nice and quiet small but enough for 6 or more,2
this restaurant was way overhyped,0
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily,0
okay i do n t mind the oily part cause most are cooked that way but it was way too bland,0
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary,2
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant,2
it s boring on the inside and our sushi was pretty below average the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor,0
i definitely would n t go back,0
their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic,2
the price is reasonable although the service is poor,1
great for a romantic evening or a fun evening with friends,2
i will be going back very soon,2
keep up the good work,2
it was wonderful,2
the salads are delicious both refreshing and very spicy,2
we had pam s special fried fish and it was amazing,2
too large for just two people but nothing was left,0
great vibe lots of people,2
my husbands was perfect my was well done and dry,2
i did n t complain i liked the atmosphere so much,2
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch,2
ambience is so cute and quaint good for business although we were there on vacation,2
salads were fantastic,2
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great,2
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me,2
we will be back,2
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i ve had at this price range,2
the yellowtail was particularly good as well,2
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal however the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than 18 by just going off the menu,0
in any event this is a place i ll be sure to stop by again when i m in this part of town,2
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment,1
they have it all great price food and service,2
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can,0
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently,2
and it all comes at a very reasonable price congee noodles and rice dishes are no more than 3 6 each,2
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well,2
enjoyed a very nice caesar salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese both very tasty,2
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh,2
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake both were delicious,2
we d go back again,1
i recently went to this restaurant with some co workers for lunch and had an amazing time,2
the staff was accomodating the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely,2
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves,2
yes the prices are high but i felt it was worth it,2
we all felt it was worth it,2
sometimes i get good food and ok service,2
sometimes i get bad food and bad service sometimes i get good good and bad service,0
it is not consistent,0
the place is a bistro which means simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere,2
and where does patis go wrong no where,0
you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but cassuolet steake fritte tripe stew etc simple stuff,0
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza,2
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta raddichio was kind of bitter though,2
my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better,2
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day,2
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids,1
overall i would recommend it and go back again,2
i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two,2
mmmmm it was delicious,2
service was slow but the people were friendly,2
it s a nice place to relax and have conversation,2
i ca n t wait to go back,1
the food is authentic italian delicious,2
pizza is terrific as is homemade pasta,2
ambience is delightful service impeccable,2
service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great,0
do not try unless you re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste,0
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try,2
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent,2
the filet mignon dish was superb,2
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices,2
it s a small cute restaurant,2
i absolutely love this place,2
i like the ambience it s very dark and original,2
the sushi is amazing,2
and amazingly cheap,2
very affordable and excellent ambient,2
we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai,0
we were very disappointed,0
we wo n t go to this place again for a good meal,1
however i think this place is a good hang out spot,2
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time,2
they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter so i m looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it,2
check this place out,0
highly recommended,2
first of all this place is not romantic as claimed by citysearch s editorial review,0
either that or the editor s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th,1
the tables are crammed way too close the menu is typical of any italian restaurant and the wine list is simply overpriced,0
slightly above average wines start at 70 with only one selection listed at 30,1
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category,0
for instance plates were just dumped on the table i was handed the wine list upside down etc,0
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service,0
to be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food which was above average but could n t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora,1
not one of our meals was edible bland and or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring,0
fish was overdone,0
cute place nice wait staff but would never go there again,2
someone else recommended the dessert we also left that,1
one of us actually liked the expresso that s it,2
skip this restaurant it s a big disappointment,0
myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the city the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else,2
i ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious,2
their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for,2
i come from a family of pizzeria owners and i m almost ashamed to say that the pizza in fornino s blows my families receipies away,0
the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious,2
i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try,2
you will find yourself returning quite often,1
a restaurant that does n t try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere,2
no gimmicks here the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation,2
the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over how refreshing,2
the service was impeccable and unobtrusive the staff knows what they are there to do to know their menu present your meal and attend to your needs,2
looking around i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen,2
the view is breathtaking the service is top notch the ambiance is wonderful,2
the staff offers impeccable service,2
i had lobster bisque it has 2 oz of maine lobster in it,1
my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque,2
it was divine melts in your mouth,2
my boyfriend had prime rib it was good,2
we did n t want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of korbett it was just enough,1
it s cuz it s so good you need to taste it,2
all in all we re already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks,1
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food,1
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo,1
it s very spicy but not offensive,1
we will definitely go back,2
go to volare for 1st class service and terrific food,2
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter,2
the wine list is excellent,2
the food is amazing especially if you get the chef s tasting menu and your favourite bottle or two of wine from an extensive selection of wines,2
the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded but the service is excellent and it s great for friends out a romantic date or a special occassion,2
the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n t like,2
please be aware that it s cash or amex only,1
with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering the food here was decent not great,0
we ordered the special grilled branzino that was so infused with bone it was difficult to eat,0
the decor in this place is very diner ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village not romantic just simple small and sparse,0
problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable,0
no plans to return anytime soon,1
this place is so much fun,2
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant,2
our food was great too,2
and really large portions,1
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york,2
if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde,1
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects,2
the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions,2
i highly recommend it,2
the place is a lot of fun,2
my six year old loved it,2
the food however is what one might expect,1
it is very overpriced and not very tasty,0
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them,1
service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded,0
drinks way over priced,0
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit,0
great pizza for lunch place,2
service was quick,1
the pizza was great,2
and it was quick which is very important,2
have the iced tea,1
whenever you need a sushi fix mizu will be there with quality fish and great service,2
delivery is fast too,2
great friendly service fast seating fast delivery excellent sushi,2
ess a bagel either by sty town or midtown is by far the best bagel in ny,2
the bagels always warm soft on the inside crispy on the outside and enormous in size,2
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great,2
the lox is always fresh too,2
highly recommended to all,2
not impressed with the food,0
prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant,0
zero ambiance to boot,1
i thought this place was totally overrated,0
everything we had was good or ok but definitely nothing great,0
the ambience was nice but service was n t so great,2
when you add it all together it just does n t seem worth it to me especially considering the prices,0
this is the best shabu shabu restaurant in the try state area,2
thius is a must for anyone who loves shabu shabu,2
the atmosphere is nothing special but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo,1
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance,2
despite a slightly limited menu everything prepared is done to perfection ultra fresh and a work of food art,2
i must give it yon out of yon stars,1
taxan delicious,2
this restaurant was recommended by a local as a matter of fact he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed,2
we were n t,1
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food,1
we liked it so much that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york,2
the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it,2
there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me,2
try green curry with vegetables,1
the quantity is also very good you will come out satisfied,2
the service is ok some of the people did n t get what they asked for,1
i was there on sat for my birthday and we had an excellent time,2
i had the best ravioli ever,2
the wine the service was very good too,2
moderate prices,1
a little noise but i think that was because of our party,1
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list,2
the food is delicious from the specials to the regular menu fare the dishes are never a disappointment,2
whether it s the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite,1
although the tables may be closely situated the candle light food quality and service overcompensate,0
a guaranteeed delight,2
i have known about this secret for the last 13 years emilio the godfather has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices,1
if you go try the marinara arrabiatta sauce the mozzarella en carozza is mmmmmmmm everything is just delicious,2
i pray it stays open forever,2
i found the food service and value exceptional everytime i have been there,2
i felt as though i were eating in paris,1
the service was excellent friendly and attentive,2
the prices are wonderfully low,2
very good wine choices,2
who has room for cheesesticks with the best pizza in nyc,2
get the pepperoni yum and a family style salad,2
great staff,2
always great service,2
i go twice a month,1
the food is good i ca n t lie,2
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out,0
we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order,1
this place is pricey and yes the food is worth it but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price,0
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one,0
amma is nothing special,0
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive,0
will not be back,0
do n t dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes they are simply not up to par with the non veg selections,0
this place is always packed,0
most importantly food is excellent,2
try the sea bass,1
highly recommended,2
first of all dal bukhara rocks,1
i am happy i did the food was awsome,2
and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs,2
but overall i give it a 10,2
10,1
haru on park s is simply disgusting,0
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale,0
quite frankly this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried,0
will never be back,0
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives,0
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly,0
the all u can eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality,0
wont come back again for sure,1
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce even its low sodium the vinegar soaked rice and the scallion on top of the fish,1
the waitstaffs are nice though,2
i have been to roth s twice and both times were very disappointing,0
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service which was boarderline rude,0
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another,0
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you,0
the dinner was ok nothing i would have again,2
this was a great surprise,2
i look forward to eating here again,2
planet thai is great,2
we love the food drinks and atmosphere,2
the svc can be a bit rude at times esp if you have big group but overall the restaurant is a must,0
try the pad thai it s fabulous and their prices are so cheap,2
just because it s cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty it is great,2
they forgot a sandwich did n t include plastic forks and did n t include pita with the hummus platter,0
also the sandwiches nearing 7 did n t come with anything like chips or a side,1
overall not worth the money,0
eating in the atmosphere saves it but at your desk it s a very disappointing experience,0
chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city,2
they have authentic indian at amazing prices,2
this restaurant is vegetarian there are no meat dishes whatsoever,1
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches,0
it s a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early,0
the food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate,2
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates,2
not a great place for family or general dining,0
food is excellent,2
fish is so very fresh,2
waitstaff are very friendly,2
love yuka,2
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood,2
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great,2
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing,2
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices,0
even though its good seafood the prices are too high,0
the lobster sandwich is 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price,0
we were very pleasantly surprised,2
the food was delicious i had a halibut special my husband had steak and the service was top notch,2
when my dessert came there was a candle in it not because anyone asked for one but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort,1
truly the mark of an attentive waiter,1
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night,2
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods,0
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods,0
they do n t concern much of customer s health just want to make money,0
please do n t fool us,0
i recommend the jelly fish drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings certainly the stir fry blue crab,2
the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice,2
of course it is crowded but who cares,0
authentic shanghai style and i can not recommend a better shanghai place in new york,2
have frequented ino for several years and the food remains excellent,2
cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at 10,2
the large selection of bruschettas paninis tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating,1
the asparagus truffle oil parmesan bruschetta is a winner,2
be sure to try the seasonal and always delicious specials,2
definitely a neighborhood favorite,2
i loved this place,2
i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded,2
i like cafe noir dont get me wrong it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent,0
the service was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served,0
the waitress seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing,0
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend asked him where are you from maybe you dont know how things work in america and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on,0
we did tip i guess the model waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager,1
pizza here is consistently good,2
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal,2
it is thick and slightly soggy,1
decor is charming,2
service is average,0
what a great place,2
the ambience was so fun and the prices were great on top of the fact that the food was really tasty,2
i was n t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes but i guess that s the price you pay for a popular place,0
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine,2
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever,0
a gentleman maybe the manager came to our table and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order,1
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude,1
never again,0
i absolutely loved this place,2
excellent atmosphere delicious dishes good and friendly service,2
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions,1
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation,2
the wine list is also really nice,2
i have been to casimir over 5 times and i have always had a great time there,2
the food is great and reasonably priced,2
i have tried to make reservations but both times the hostess did n t have my name,0
if the weather is nice try to snag an outside table,2
the staff has been nice but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often,1
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent,2
from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it,2
considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed,2
i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service,2
nice family owned traditional restaurant,2
i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken,2
i found the food to be outstanding particulary the salmon dish i had,2
i also ordered the change mojito which was out of this world,1
my friends settled for rice dishes but we came back the following day to try the dim sum which was good not outstanding but good,2
we ate out in the back patio which is worth it as it s cool and the music is hear well there,2
overall excellent restaurant,2
the food was good,2
the place was nice and calm,2
but the service was a bit slow,0
the buffet had a nice selection,2
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes,2
service was also very good,2
i would go back,2
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries,2
i would recommend roxy s for that but not for their food,1
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge,2
but they were too big for the bun,0
consequently their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did nt feel like finishing them,0
also they were 15 each,1
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll,2
it was 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami but it did n t have much taste i ve had better for less elsewhere,1
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant the food,0
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish,0
and the tom kha soup was pathetic,0
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go,0
we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday and i was thoroughly impressed with the food,2
the pesto pizza was excellent thin crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that i d never heard of before,2
conveniently located too being right on bedford ave,2
the back garden sitting area is very pleasant where you can see their personal herb garden,2
we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic,2
my husband said he could ve eaten several more the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had,2
we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful,2
we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right,2
love the food,2
it s the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food,2
and you ca n t beat the prices,0
i ve lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all,2
great food good size menu great service and an unpretensious setting,2
the dishes offered were unique very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages sardines with biscuits large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream the best and freshest i ve ever had,2
i m glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny,2
the freshest best variety and the fastest delivery,2
also very inexpensive,2
the service was excellent and the food was delicious,2
we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included ceviche mix special crab dumplings assorted sashimi sushi and rolls two types of sake and the banana tempura,2
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date,2
average to good thai food but terrible delivery,0
i ve waited over one hour for food,0
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice,0
a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner,1
the food arrived 20 minutes after i called cold and soggy,1
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money,2
an excellent service,2
we were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial,2
she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about indian food,2
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates,2
we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun dessert recommended by the waiter,2
i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others,2
service here was great food was fantastic,2
guacamole shrimp appetizer was really great we both had the filet very good did n t much like the frites that came with but the filet was so good neither of us cared,2
will absolutely visit again,2
you can not go wrong with this place,2
the food is outstanding and the service is quick friendly and very professional,2
always a nice crowd but never loud,2
go here,1
good for dates or with friends,2
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded,0
however it is jus too good to not praise it,2
by far the best pizza in manhattan,2
the crust is thin the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly,2
the menu has so many fish items and oysters,2
the fish was really really fresh,2
we all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in new york,2
i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood,2
all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better,2
i highly recommend the sophia pizza,2
it s to die for,0
the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back,0
immediately after we paid the waiter took the money and said okay you guys are outta here,1
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary,0
for the people who want great food plus great service roxy is a place to avoid,0
the first time the sushi was outstanding the second time it was a little bland,1
i m sure i ll return for a final judgement tho,1
the blond wood decor is very soothing the premium sake is excellent and the service is great,2
mizu is the japenese find in grammercy,1
while their kitchen food is delicious their sushi is out of this world,2
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else,2
not only is the cuisine the best around the service has always been attentive and charming,2
warning you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu,1
the entree was bland and small dessert was not inspired,0
i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu,0
the view is spectacular and the food is great,2
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well,2
definitely worth the trip to battery park city,2
one of my favorite places in manhattan,2
authentic taiwanese food that s cheap what more could you ask for,2
besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city,1
the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan,1
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere,2
kind attentive wait staff,1
i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi on saffron risotto yum,2
my friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos,2
delicious crab cakes too,2
even if the food was n t this good the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax,2
great neighborhood joint,2
this is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice,2
their calzones are horrific bad vomit inducing yuck,0
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone,0
the counter service is bad,0
they charge different prices all the time,0
they re rude at times and not very friendly,0
no pizza 33 for me,1
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet where greasy dry and tasteless are complimentary,0
the dosas are skimpy unattractive and drip with grease and personally i d drink popcorn topping before i d eat another one of these,0
the sandwiches are dry tasteless and way overpriced,0
calling the place hampton chutney co does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too,0
seriously this place kicks ass,2
the atmosphere is unheralded the service impecible and the food magnificant,1
best italian food i ever had and being italian that means alot,2
it is nearly impossible to get a table so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner do not pass it up,1
this is such a lovely peaceful place to eat outside,2
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty,2
it is set far from the small street it s on and there is no traffic noise,1
this is a great place to take out of towners and perfect for watching the sunset,2
great sushi experience,2
nice value,2
unique apppetizers,1
try sushimi cucumber roll,1
good spreads great beverage selections and bagels really tasty,2
murray wo n t do it,1
but who says murray s is anything about service,0
so close but not good enough,0
do n t be fooled by crowds of people,1
the service is awful,0
this place is not worth the prices,0
also do n t plan on asking for your favorite roll if it s not on the menu you ca n t have it,1
love pizza 33,2
i will be out with friends and all of a sudden i am hungry and i only crave one thing their pizza,1
it hits the spot every time,2
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising,2
the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc,2
they even scoop it out nice for those on a diet not too much not to little,2
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee,2
a little crowded but they move that line really fast,1
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning,2
bagels are ok but be sure not to make any special requests,1
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere,0
be sure not to get anything other than bagels,1
the worst excuse for japanese food i ve ever encountered,0
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water,1
the sushi was awful,0
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard,0
furthermore the rice had no seasoning so the sushi was bland and disgusting,0
the fish was adequate but inexpertly sliced,1
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine,0
good fast service,2
i would highly recommend,2
food is great and inexpensive,2
the location is perfect,2
give it a try and enjoy,2
well this place is so ghetto its not even funny,0
if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you ll love it here,2
would never go back there,0
awsome pizza especially the margheritta slice,2
always busy but fast moving,1
great atmoshere and worth every bit,2
open late well as late as i ever got there and i m a night person,1
winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you,2
the food is reliable and the price is moderate,2
what more can you ask for,1
everything about this restaurant was special,2
the service was attentive yet discreet,2
the flavors robust and subtle,2
the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal,2
i m saving up for my next visit,1
the place was quiet and delightful,2
i did not try the caviar but i tried their salmon and crab salad they are all good,2
as a retired hipster i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laid back late night in the city,2
the wait staff is pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeous in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way not in that she s way cuter than me that b way,2
the food is yummy especially their cooked to perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries,2
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere delightfully free of the bts,2
you can get a completely delish martini in a glass that s about 2 1 2 drinks for 8 50 i recommend the vanilla shanty mmmm in a great homey setting with great music,2
the in house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music and moreover takes requests,2
you ca n t go wrong with this place,0
suan is a great place that i often take my friends classmates too,2
its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable makes students go back to suan again and again,2
i love their thai,2
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must,2
i will go back to suan soon,1
in summer eat outside on a terrace another great feature of suan,2
i can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant,0
i can not imagine better indian food in all of the city,2
i can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there,0
during the course of the past 3 months the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better,0
i wish they would change back to what it was before,1
the food now is inconsistent,0
this is the kind of place you d like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret,1
the setting is casual and romantic,2
prices are very good,2
the food is excellent,2
if you re daring try the balsamic vinegar over icecream it s wonderful,2
they were such a rip off 8 95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns and not worth trying,0
the rest of the dim sum though pricey by chinatown standards is worth it,2
the wait here is long for dim sum but if you do n t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig this is a sleek for chinatown alternative,0
a few tips skip the turnip cake roast pork buns and egg custards,1
these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner,2
i was pleasantly suprised,2
the food was exceptional,2
i choose to go with one of the special the braised lamb shank in red wine which was excellent,2
the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual,2
the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal,1
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices,2
the pad se ew chicken was delicious however the pad thai was far too oily,2
have eaten at ginger house several times and it s always good,2
the fried dumplings are great,2
finally a reliable chinese restaurant,2
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service,2
the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat but planning an event especially a small intimate one forget about it,1
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place but also become hostile,0
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end not one person takes responsibility for anything,0
terrible terrible management deserves to be shut down,0
never fails to please,2
delicious bagels especially when right out of the oven,2
spreads and toppings are great though a bit pricey,2
service is fast and friendly,2
only drawback they wo n t toast your bagel and they do n t make eggs for the bagel,0
but that is highly forgivable,0
been there done that and new york it s not that big a deal,1
the food is decent at best and the ambience well it s a matter of opinion some may consider it to be a sweet thing i thought it was just annoying,0
if celebrities make you sweat then your in for a ride but if your like most around these parts then you ll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype,0
rao is a good restaurant but it s nothing special,0
but after last night spice grill is the only place i m eating indian cuisine,1
you must try the shrimp appetizers,2
even my indian friend could n t believe how good and tasty everything was,2
this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time,2
great food great prices great service,2
if you are looking for a good quality cheap eats this is the place,2
it s a perfect place to have a amazing indian food,2
i really loved the different and inovated touch that s the cheff gives to the food,2
also it s great to have dinner in a very romantic and comfortable place the service it s just perfect they re so frendly that we never want to live the place,2
their bagels are fine but they are a little overcooked and not really a special bagel experience,1
great bagels made the old fashioned way,2
drawbacks service is slow and they do n t toast,0
the food was absolutely amazing,2
the baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we ve ever had,2
the lamb was tender so full of flavor the dessert was divine,2
the waiter was attentive,2
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening,2
downtown dinner 2002 prixe fix appetizers were ok waiter gave me poor suggestion try the potato stuff kanish best one,1
dessert is a joke dont bother,0
volare virgins or weekly regulars everyone gets treated the same and you ca n t ask for more than that when the service is this friendly,1
the restaurant has a family feel not least with regard to the portions which are enormous the veal alone could have single handedly solved third world famine,2
the anti pasta was excellent especially the calamari as were the filling pasta mains,2
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal,2
still any quibbles about the bill were off set by the pour your own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house,1
fantastic place,2
a pleasant surprise,2
go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else,2
lucky strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat,2
great food great decor great service,2
i recommend it,2
this is the perfect spot for meeting friends having lunch dinner pre theatre or after theatre drinks,2
always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer,1
guaranteed to be a tasty experience,2
i have been doing all of the above at the heartland brewery for over 5 years now and i have never been disappointed,2
all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends,1
go there once and oh yes you will go back you will,2
a cool bar with great food and tons of excellent beer,2
and even with it s pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too,2
loved it,2
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful,2
it is expensive but well worth the money,2
if you venture off the island of manhattan and ca n t seem to find a great italian restaurant drive to corona,1
the only thing more wonderful than the food which is exceptional is the service,2
the only thing the waiters do n t do for you is wipe your chin when you leave,0
wonderful at holiday time,2
cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most,1
food was very good but not what i would consider out of this world,1
go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience,1
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian,2
too bad the food was n t of the same heritage,0
the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless so was the seafood tagliatelle,0
a real dissapointment,0
but that was n t the icing on the cake a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had,0
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips good but a far cry from what the name implies,1
priced at upper intermediate range,1
it was pretty inexpensive too,2
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city,2
it s great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend,2
it s definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone,0
however if you want great food at a great price and do n t mind the decor you ca n t beat this place,2
quick and friendly service,2
this is one of the best comfort food places in the city,2
it s somewhere you can eat and be happy,2
when you re sitting in their main dining room which has a spectacular hand painted high ceiling you d never know there was a world outside,2
the food is wonderful tasty and filling and the service is professional and friendly,2
i ca n t wait for summer when they serve outside on their gigantic patio,2
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money,2
the service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals,2
i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood,2
they all know you,1
good food,2
good drink,2
how do you rate home,1
i have never had cheescake like this,0
i thought i had died and gone to heaven,0
great spot whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner,2
warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months,2
the food is great and they have a good selection of wines at reasonable prices,2
we were less than impressed,0
while the ambiance and atmosphere were great the food and service could have been a lot better,2
we ordered the chicken casserole but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken all dark meat and on the bone,1
probably would not go again,0
i ve been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine if not good,2
stick with the chicken beef and lamb dishes,1
service is friendly and never had a problem walking in and getting a table,2
skip dessert,1
best reuben sandwich ever,2
a classic,1
do n t miss bloom s on your next trip to manhatten,1
it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york,1
thanks bloom s for a lovely trip,2
the food was not fresh the sauces were bland and very oily,0
it just was n t thai,1
was surprisingly disappointed,0
pizza was a little soggy,0
ravioli was good but i have to say that i found everything a bit overpriced,0
not enough wines by the glass either,0
service however was excellent and i liked the setting atmosphere a lot,2
food was just average if they lowered the prices just a bit it would be a bigger draw,1
authentic pakistani food,1
just straight up cheap good food,2
faan is sooo good,2
the design and atmosphere is just as good,2
bottles of wine are cheap and good,2
what more could you want,2
the food was actually aweful,2
i m not picky but it was actually gross,0
the mussles were the fishiest things i ve ever tasted the seabass was bland the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese the penne w chicken had bones in it it was disgusting,0
nice atmosphere the service was very pleasant and the desert was good,2
this is the perfect date spot for williamsburg couples,2
the jukebox plays everything from italian opera to the strokes,1
the food is amazing rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza,2
best of all is the warm vibe the owner is super friendly and service is fast,2
if only they delivered they d make a mint,1
go here for the drinks,1
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm,2
my fav was the sassy lassi,2
this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls,2
i really recommend the very simple unda egg rolls,2
delicate spices onions eggs and a kick ass roti,2
amazing,2
toons has recently been redone so it s now a very attractive space,2
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food this is one of the best spots,2
went here last night nice decor good service but the food was surprisingly excellent,2
the portions are huge so it might be good to order three things to split rather than one appetizer and entree per person for two people,1
ca n t wait to go back,2
beef noodle soup is good as well,2
the service is good and the resturant is clean,2
best taiwanese food in ny,2
i have been to rao s probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better,2
rao s has the best service and atmosphere in nyc,2
good luck getting a table,2
my roommate and i love this place,2
we recently decided to try this location and to our delight they have outdoor seating perfect since i had my yorkie with me,2
indoor was very cozy and cute,2
the portion sizes here are huge and the sushi is good,2
staff is very accomodating,2
excellent dumplings served amid clean chic decor,2
i got the 10 10 piece dim sum combo every bite of which was great,2
but 1 for each small piece,1
i wo n t go back unless someone else is footing the bill,0
the decor is very simple but comfortable,2
the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach,2
the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that,2
you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert,2
the staff there is very attentive and down to earth,2
i loved it and would go again,2
great indian food and the service is incredible,2
the owner truly caters to all your needs,2
when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets and then ordered for them,1
everyone was more then happy with his choices,2
great food and the prices are very reasonable,2
the food here does a great service to the name cantonese that is,2
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork,2
try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh a delicious and sweet tasting bread,2
simply some good tasting chinese food at incredible prices,2
service is not what you are coming here for,0
whoever the jazz duo was they were on point,2
good music great food speedy service affordable prices,2
even the wine by the glass was good,2
its a little out of the way if you do n t live in the neighborhood but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are,2
consistently good japanese tapas,2
always good drinks and service is pretty good,2
atmosphere is nice and relaxed too,2
a great place to meet up for some food and drinks,2
yakitori bbq meats is tasty too,2
if you do n t mind pre sliced low quality fish unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place,0
price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit,0
was n t going to share but i feel obligated while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing,0
no thanks,1
this place which is only a few months old is perhaps queens biggest secret,1
fabulous decor makes you feel like you re in a trendy manhattan restaurant very very good food cheaply priced generally friendly staff and if you re a manhattanite or spend most of your time in manhattan rice avenue will make you feel at home very soho village upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele all on roosevelt avenue,2
we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date,0
we were then shooed inside,1
one would think we d get an apology or complimentary drinks instead we got a snobby waiter would n t even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so,0
we left never to return,1
with so many good restaurants on the uws i do n t need overpriced food absurdly arrogant wait staff who do n t recognize they work at a glorified diner clumsy service and management that does n t care,0
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overated and on the pricey side,0
baluchi s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices,2
the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent,0
he offers subpar service and has no personality,0
in fact it appears he is going to go postal at any moment,1
there is no excuse for such lousy service,0
i have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri,1
you can do it here,2
20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten,1
i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends and spent three enjoyable hours there,2
most of the servers are very attentive friendly and quite attractive,2
the vibe is very relaxed and cozy service was great and the food was excellent,2
food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went,2
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window,2
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat,2
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights,2
i heartily recommend,2
there is a downside if you re ordering in the delivery guys have major attitude,0
never have i had such dramatic delivery guys a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b c i live in a walkup who always seem disappointed with their tips,0
love the scene first off the place has a character and nice light to it very fortunate location wise,2
the pizza was pretty good and huge,2
the price very reasonable,2
we were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion a bucket of food literally,1
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n t not mention or undermine,1
the pasta penne was pretty extra buttery creamy which means a big task to diggest tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count penne got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed lol,2
i love it,2
i plan on stopping by next week as well,1
i found it on a cold night the perfect spot to warm up,2
i recieved prompt service with a smile,2
to me it exemplifies soho cute artsy interesting,2
definately check it out,1
this place blew me away by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side,2
the wine list is extensive and impressive,2
love the atmosphere felt like i was in paris,2
the mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert definitely going to be back very soon,2
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna,2
over the years the host vittorio and his crew have always treated me as family although with all the business this not so little gem does it amazing he s even able to remember a consistent but not so frequent visitor,2
i ve also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years a new jazz bar the most fantastic dining garden the best thin crust pizzas and now a lasagna menu which is to die for these are not your average lasagnas,2
i love this place,2
keep up the good work guys,2
i have to say i have never had a disapointing meal here,1
we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu,2
luckily we saved room for the bbq salmon sea bass and crispy duck,2
love al di la,1
i recommend this place to everyone,2
great food,2
one of my favorite places in brooklyn,2
the pastas are incredible the risottos particularly the sepia are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing,2
overpriced and not tasty,0
it was totally overpriced fish and chips was about 15,0
tasty dog,0
an awesome organic dog and a conscious eco friendly establishment,2
one of the best hot dogs i have ever eaten,2
but the best pork souvlaki i ever had is the main thing,2
run do n t walk,1
super yummy pizza,2
i was visiting new york city with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant,2
i looove their eggplant pizza as well as their pastas,2
we had half half pizza mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza,2
we had fun eating in there we were there like around 3 a m in the morning,2
excellent food although the interior could use some help,2
great sake,1
reliable fresh sushi,1
the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious,2
have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once,1
delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week,1
delivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n t tip more than 10,0
best sushi ever,2
this place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi,0
creative consistent fresh,1
excellent sashimi and the millennium roll is beyond delicious,2
not cheap but very yummy,2
very very nice,2
not only is the food,1
loved it,2
we had a very nice time,2
the waiter was attentive the food was delicious and the views of the city were great,2
i d definitely go back again,2
great place to relax and enjoy your dinner,2
there is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week,2
place is open till late no dress code,1
good food my favorite is the seafood spaghetti,2
excellent food for great prices,2
my husband and i have been sold on this from the first visit,2
the wait staff is very courteous and accomodating,2
the space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes 1 hour but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo chinese food,2
there are no negatives to speak of,1
the bestt,2
my favorite place lol,2
its alright,2
im not necessarily fanatical about this place but it was a fun time for low pirces,2
lobster was good nothing spectacular,2
its just a fun place to go not a five star restaraunt,2
had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive,0
would never go back,1
i was n t here for the pizza so i ca n t comment on that yet but what i had was very good,2
everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome,2
i ordered the vitello alla marsala and i was pretty impressed,2
the veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly,2
the potato balls were not dry at all in fact it was buttery,2
the only downside they only take cash which is ok if you know about it ahead of time,1
i ll be back for sure,2
worst place on smith street in brooklyn,0
very immature bartender didnt know how to make specific drinks service was so slowwwww the food was not fresh or warm waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers,0
i would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner,0
awesome,2
the food is always fresh,2
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service,0
went here on sat 1 26 and was disappointed,0
food was luke warm,1
i was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have,0
not because you are the four seasons you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner,1
the food was excellent as well as service however i left the four seasons very dissappointed,2
i do not think dinner in manhattan should cost 400 00 where i am not swept off my feet,0
red dragon roll my favorite thing to eat of any food group hands down,2
if you do n t like it i do n t know what to tell you,0
the seafood dynamite is also otherworldly,1
i m not even going to bother to describe it it speaks for itself,1
an unpretentious spot in park slope the sushi is consistently good the service is pleasant effective and unassuming,2
in the summer months the back garden area is really nice,2
the dancing white river and millenium rolls are musts,2
so good,2
i can eat here every day of the week really lol love this place,2
gross food wow,0
i ca n t remember the last time i had such gross food in new york,0
and 11 for a plate of bland guacamole,1
do n t get me started on the margaritas either,1
mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila,0
oh and i never write reviews i just was so moved by how bad this place was i felt it was my duty to spread the word,0
great indian food,2
when i got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly,1
the food was good the place was clean and affordable,2
i noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place,2
this is one of my favorite spot very relaxing the food is great all the times celebrated my engagement and my wedding here it was very well organized,2
the staff is very good,2
love their drink menu,2
i highly recommend this beautiful place,2
nice for one time special occasion,2
they honored reservation on sunday afternoon very well,2
we were offered water for the table but were not told the voss bottles of water were 8 a piece,1
food was ok,2
nice view of river and nyc,2
i come here enjoy very much with husband,2
remind me of home,1
great survice,2
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so delicious,2
a beautifully designed dreamy egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night,2
watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that s more lemony than smoky,2
oh and there s hookah,1
raymond the bartender rocks,2
pacifico is a great place to casually hang out,2
the drinks are great especially when made by raymond,2
the omlette for brunch is great,2
quacamole at pacifico is yummy as are the wings with chimmichuri,2
a weakness is the chicken in the salads,0
it s just average just shredded no seasoning on it,0
also i personally was n t a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole,0
overall decent food at a good price with friendly people,2
best indian restaurant in the city,2
this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york,2
what really makes it shine is the food which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices and all made in house even the gyro meat and sausages and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected,2
all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent but the gyro is the reason to come if you do n t eat one your trip was wasted,2
best restaurant in brooklyn,2
the best,2
great food amazing service this place is a class act,2
the veal was incredible last night,2
fresh mind blowing flavors,2
this place is a must visit,2
delicious creative and fun,2
got a date go here,1
every time i have a special occasion with my boyfriend i have a hard time going anywhere else,2
it is so romantic,2
its dark and cozy there is always jazz music playing when we go,2
most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like that couple,1
the food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together,2
i ve enjoyed 99 of the dishes we ve ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too authentic for me dish i m a daring eater but not that daring,2
once you try it for a special occasion beware you ca n t stop,1
you ll be there for every anniversary birthday valentines day,2
for a fabulous wedding,2
everyone raved about the atmosphere elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views and the fabulous food,2
service was wonderful,2
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful,2
paul the maitre d was totally professional and always on top of things,2
thank you everyone at water s edge,2
would not go back,1
service ok but unfriendly filthy bathroom,0
the bar drinks were eh ok to say the least,2
the stuff tilapia was horrid tasted like cardboard,0
we thought the dessert would be better wrong,1
170 down the toilet,0
oh speaking of bathroom the mens bathroom was disgusting,0
the floor was wet the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor no soap and no hand towels left,0
good experience,2
the wine list was extensive though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings,1
the bread we received was horrible rock hard and cold and the free appetizer of olives was disappointing,0
however our main course was wonderful,2
i had fish and my husband had the filet both of which exceeded our expectations,1
the dessert we had a pear torte was good but once again the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions,0
when we inquired about ports the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost,1
all in all i would return as it was a beautiful restaurant but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future,2
short and sweet seating is great it s romantic cozy and private,2
the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they re perfect for 2 people,2
the service was extremely fast and attentive thanks to the service button on your table but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order,2
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals,1
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food,0
will prob not return but it is a great dinning experience to try at least once,2
noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food i enjoy,2
servers are all different greg is my favorite,2
sometimes tables do n t understand his sense of humor but it s refreshing to have a server who has personality professionalism and respects the privacy of your dinner,2
this is the first place i ve been that a runner remembers my order hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant,1
prices are fair across the board for both food and bev,2
i go out to eat and like my courses servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink,1
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings,2
this place had all the trimmings and i mean all,1
peppers onions relish chilli cheeses you name it,1
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out,2
best dining experience in the west village,2
stepping into casa la femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york,2
highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night i had,2
the have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for,2
we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd,2
i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending,2
maggot in the food,0
the menu looked great and the waiter was very nice but when the food came it was average,2
nevertheless i finished my plate and that s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom,1
i showed it to the manager and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for,1
the manager finally said he would com p the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food and made it seem like a big concession,1
we paid and left because we did n t feel like arguing any more,1
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food,0
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service,0
unhygienic,0
i do not recommend,0
i got hair in my food 2 times of then,0
great place great value,2
the food is flavorful plentiful and reasonably priced,2
the atmosphere is relaxed and casual,2
it s a great place to order from or sit in,2
inexpensive unassuming great time,2
sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance,2
try it,1
very pleased,2
good creative rolls,2
yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much,2
they have great rolls the triple color and norwegetan rolls are awesome and filling,2
one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up but save room for dessert,2
they have a delicious banana chocolate dessert as well as a great green tea tempura,2
the appetizers are also delicious,2
mazing interior,2
great food,2
i ve had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers,2
the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors,1
if you re into being lost when you re just five feet from your table then hey that s a good thing,2
despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go to for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future,2
indo chinese food pretty good,2
not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food,2
the chicken lollipop is my favorite most of the dishes i have to agree with a previous reviewer are quite oily and very spicy espeically the chilli chicken,2
my mom originally introduced me to this place but even she being indian feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily,0
still we keep going back,1
i was speechless by the horrible food,0
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant and the food was majorly disappointing,0
i was so stunned and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing,0
this place survives on reputation alone,1
i will never return,0
best in all of nyc,2
this is the most wonderful restaurant in all of new york city not just brooklyn,2
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty most delicious food and kept it that way,2
never swaying never a bad meal never bad service,1
you should travel from the bronx to try it,1
great food great wine list great service in a great neighborhood,2
so delicious,2
patsy s pizza true love,2
hands down the best pizza on the planet,2
in about 12 minutes the thing is gone,1
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside,2
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost,2
great taste,2
great original taste,2
for me dishes a little oily but overall dining experience good,2
helpful service and average price per dish 10,2
great food,2
this place has great indian chinese food,2
the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal,2
be prepared to wait because the place is pretty tiny,1
also they do not take credit card so come with cash,1
even though the place is not beautiful the food speaks for itself,1
best indian chinese in the city by far,2
amazing my favorite,2
i came across village underground by accident now i go there all the time,1
the service is amazing i ve had different waiters and they were all nice which is a rare thing in nyc,2
the dj is awesome i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going back,2
you can get a table without a reservation if you get there early i they do n t make you by bottles,1
which lets face it at times it s a good thing,2
in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time,2
highly recommended,2
one of the best if not the best restaurants in park slope and ny in general,2
everything on the menu is great,2
this establishment is the real deal,1
wish ny had more of these kind of places intimate superb food homey top notch all the way around certainly worth the wait,2
but 500 for a dinner for two that did n t include wine,1
look the appetizers were really good,2
the entree was also very good,2
ca n t argue about that but they are clearly over priced,0
what you are paying for is the environment and the name,1
yes the place is classy and beautiful but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while,2
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef,1
surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe,2
vanison was good but not amazing,0
bison was quite excellent however,2
dessert pure disaster,0
just not good at all,0
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all,0
i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself but may be it is worth it,1
the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants but trust me they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say i ve been to the four seasons restaurant,1
all in all the food was great except for the dessserts,2
if you are going for the food it will not be worth it,0
you would think they would make up for it with service sadly no,0
service was just ok it is not what you d expect for 500,0
terrible waste of money scammers,0
i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience,2
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience,0
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time,0
our visit their to say the least was an unpleasant and costly experience,0
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience,0
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table,1
although we were told 10 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes,1
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited,2
the place is beautiful,2
the hostess was very pleasant,2
our experience did not ever get any better,2
for each course we waited over 1 2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink,0
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka,0
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner,1
we asked for beverages and never received them,0
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order,0
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin,0
i would not expect this for a 55 dinner,0
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka,0
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka some of which we never received,0
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses,1
to top it all off the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant,0
by the time we left our wallets were empty and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers,1
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible,0
i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused and wasted my hard earned money,0
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly,0
i wish i could be refunded,0
do n t go with a larger group than 4,1
at first we were a little taken aback as this seemed to present a problem although the restaurant looked fairly empty but they hastily put the table together for us,0
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions,1
there was no tap beer that evening which was a disappointment,0
not much of a selection of bottled beer either we went with brahma,1
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion maybe 3 of each,2
the lobster knuckles special of the day were ok but pretty tasteless,0
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the salt encrusted shrimp appetizer,1
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now since you are a larger party and it might get crowded,2
the food arrived in about 15 minutes,1
i had the thai style fried sea bass which was very good,2
everyone seemed generally happy with their food except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice,2
i heard the lobster roll was excellent,2
they seemed to continue to rush us along taking plates without asking if we were done my sister still had her fork in hand,1
all in all the food was good a little on the expensive side but fresh,2
service not the friendliest to our large party,0
probably would not go back here,0
great indian food,2
food was amazing i love indian food and eat it quite regularly but i can say this is one of the best i ve had,2
very normal indian food but done really well,2
also waiters try to push more food on you like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost,0
but if you re prepared to spend some and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary then this is the place to go for indian food,1
one of the best,2
bukhara grill the tagline says it all indian spice rave,1
the lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it,2
we have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given,2
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc,2
wretched and retching,1
i have never been so disgusted by both food an service,0
for starters they delivered us someone else s order,1
however once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair sometimes you have to settle when it s your only option i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting slimy clearly bad piece of fish skin,0
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation,1
none was made so i hung up,0
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet,0
my girlfriend being slightly more aggressive and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant,0
it was n t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand but now it s simply repulsive,0
gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner,2
i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot,2
i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date,2
more williamsburg garbage,0
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart,1
the bibimbap was average but the stone bowl was n t even close to sizzling,0
too bad i had paid an extra 2 for the stone bowl,0
the nakgi bokum was horrible,0
easily the worst stir fried squid i ve ever tasted,0
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean,0
the side dishes were passable and i did get a refill upon request,1
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service,0
she just nodded and walked off,1
as to my comment about the food no apology or acknowledgment was made,1
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish,0
we were charged full price,1
lives up to the hype,2
we ve tried before but it always packed and does n t take reservations,0
it was well worth the wait,2
the wife had the risotto which was amazing,2
it does n t look appetizing as it s covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black but the taste was phenomenal,0
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty,2
i love margherita pizza i looove east village pizza,2
love this place every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go,2
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza,1
the crust has a great bite and a good chew the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it the salt from the cheese is great really heightens the flavor of all the other components,2
personally i like the margherita pizza better but they are all good,2
possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city,2
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie that don t serve sushi and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city,2
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot once you enter the unmarked wooden doors the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you re no longer in the city,1
if you re planning to come here make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky,2
it s just you and your date and an occasional cute excuse me before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth,1
my party had the bbe 29 fixe prix menu which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake,2
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche,2
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better,2
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice,1
for desserts we tried the frozen black sesame mousse interesting but not extraordinary and matcha powdered green tea and blueberry cheesecake which was phenomenal,2
i do n t usually visit the same establishment more than once what more twice but i ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet unhurried and memorable dinner,2
terrible would be a compliment,0
the service leaves much to be desired from feeling like you are rushed the place your order to being ignored the rest of the night,0
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing,0
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating,0
they are extremely rude not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread,0
stay away,1
great shabu shabu,2
but for the shabu shabu you wo n t find much better in ny,1
the meat is fresh the sauces are great you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too,2
dokebi gives williamsburg the right one two punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos,1
the hot dogs are good yes but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich perfect on its supermarket squishy bun,2
restaurant with a view,1
the food tasted very good,2
the main entree was also very good,2
price is high but the food is good so i would come back again,2
this place does n t make any sense,0
just want to warn you all do n t waste your time and money,0
this place has totally weird decor stairs going up with mirrored walls i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional,0
this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird,0
the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n t work,0
good food,2
the food was great and tasty but the sitting space was too small i do n t like being cramp in a corner,0
over all it was a very nice romantic place,2
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it,2
the atmosphere was great,2
the food we ordered was excellent although i would n t say the margaritas were anything to write home about,2
our waitress was n t mean but not especially warm or attentive either,0
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year though,0
regardless we ll be back and ca n t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio,2
dumbfoundingly poor,0
this was from start to finish a mind bogglingly uncomfortable experience,0
lexicographers take note a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn,2
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention,0
polite acknowledgement is out,1
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent,0
a different server enhanced the fun dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer which was delicious,2
overall the food quality was pretty good though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n t sat cooling in front of the guest,2
the place has a nice fit out some attractive furnishings and from what i could tell a reasonable wine list i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins,2
at 120 for two people however this in no way represents value unless you re looking to pay by the hour for passive aggressive torture,0
on that scale it s a world beater,1
how is this palce still open,1
i honestly do n t even know where to begin,0
we arrived and were seated immediately which made us both happy,2
everything was going good until we got our meals,2
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled,0
it was served with skin over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes,1
i took one bite from the 24 salmon and i have never in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy as dry and as bland as the one in flatbush farms,0
at this point the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n t say anything and guess what the waitress walked away,0
so i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it,0
i could n t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach,0
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible,0
guess what i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did she says oh well i wish you would have said something earlier no apology nothing,0
after that she simply took our plates walked away came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it,1
no desert menu no apology nothing,1
this is where it really really gets bad the manager said there is absolutely nothing we can do it s a matter of taste that she did n t like it and i can not comp it,0
again no apology no is there anything else i can get you no can i get you a drink to make up for it nothing,0
the level of rudeness was preposterous,0
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want so we paid for what we did enjoy the drinks and appetizers and walked out,2
i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience,0
this staff should be fired,0
cirspy crust margherita pizza,1
it was really good pizza,2
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded,2
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review,2
i ll being with a couple of positives cool decor good pita and hummus and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty,2
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place,1
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews,1
well they can run but they ca n t hide,1
this place god where do i begin,0
the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n t notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come,0
great hot dogs,2
the hot dogs are top notch and they re slamwich is amazing,2
going to bark is always worth the train ride and will make your tongue and belly very happy,2
only complaint is the pricing i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu,1
fabulous food if the front of house staff do n t put you off,2
it s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions but we ve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years,1
each time we ve been the front of house staff not the waiters they re fantastic but the people who greet and seat you has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return,0
as bfc does n t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated which can be over an hour later,0
the frizzy retro girl with winged dame edna glasses will yell at you if you try to order a drink,0
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she had a bbq to go to that night wtf,1
i d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely,0
there s another girl who i ca n t describe she is about 5 6 with brown hair who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you re really talking about,0
i m a friendly person so i would n t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal,1
again i d be super upset if that were my employee,0
considering you will spend at least 60 a head i expect better service,1
so if you re walking by and thinking about dining you might want to see who s going to be seating you first,1
maitre d eat and get out,1
while finishing our meals which included a high end bottle of wine our son s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert,2
this guy refused to seat her and she left followed shortly by the four of us but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel including paris that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant,0
his response was smug arrogant and condescending totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening,0
if you go here do it on his off night,1
best meal in a long time,2
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening,2
my father had the flank steak which was very good and my mother had the swordfish,2
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience,2
the food is great and the environment is even better,2
everyone must come here at least once,2
highly recommend it,2
taking hot dogs to the next level,2
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint but at bark you do n t just get your average hot dog,1
here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available,2
great atmosphere,2
i highly recommend the fish tacos everything else was ok,2
cool atmosphere the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night,2
poor service and management,0
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner,0
appetizers took nearly an hour,0
never got an explanation as to what was going on,0
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly,0
on the way out we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues,1
can t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients,0
what a hassle,0
the food is very good but not outstanding,0
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table,0
on our last visit they skipped over our name on the list leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table,0
mistakes happen but they are usually accompanied by an apology perhaps even a glass of wine but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff,1
expensive,1
the pasta was well cooked did n t have enough sauce though or flavor,2
so rude,0
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience,0
the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us,0
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared,1
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane,0
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said can i help you and how many are in your party,1
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were,1
we did n t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem,0
bad staff,0
i generally like this place,2
the design of the space is good,2
but the service is horrid,0
i was there for brunch recently and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter,1
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand,0
i ca n t believe that it was but please put the bag down before delivering food,0
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere so i try to ignore it,0
i could n t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends who was in mid bite to clear the table,1
she then put the check down without asking if we were done and came to check on the bill every two minutes even though we were one of three occupied tables,1
i wish i could like this place more and i wish someone would retrain the staff,1
but the staff was so horrible to us,0
to be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food which was above average but couldnt make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora,1
the food is uniformly exceptional with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating whether its on the menu or not,2
where gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat,1
for those that go once and dont enjoy it all i can say is that they just dont get it,0
not only was the food outstanding but the little perks were great,2
it is very overpriced and not very tasty,0
our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats,2
the bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture both chewy yet not gummy,2
nevertheless the food itself is pretty good,2
they did not have mayonnaise forgot our toast left out ingredients ie cheese in an omelet below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it,0
it took half an hour to get our check which was perfect since we could sit have drinks and talk,2
the design and atmosphere is just as good,2
he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine,2
i would definitely recommend marys and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts,2
the pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza,2
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time,2
he cant help theyre bought up so fast,0
secondly on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume,1
i have eaten here a handful of times for no reason besides sheer convenience,1
obviously run by folks who know a pie,1
we were very disappointed,0
it is definitely special and affordable,2
i really liked this place,2
i will be going back very soon,2
all the money went into the interior decoration none of it went to the chefs,1
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches,0
i asked for seltzer with lime no ice,1
it was pretty inexpensive too,2
will not be back,0
dont go aloneeven two people isnt enough for the whole experience with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods,1
my suggestion is to eat family style because youll want to try the other dishes,1
best of all is the warm vibe the owner is super friendly and service is fast,2
this isnt a value joint,0
faans got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery,1
from the incredible food to the warm atmosphere to the friendly service this downtown neighborhood spot doesnt miss a beat,2
great food at reasonable prices makes for an evening that cant be beat,2
look foward to trying the ruben upon returning,2
the only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to roths is the strip house,1
we usually go to the chart house to celebrate a birthday or anniversary,2
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices,2
youll adore it,2
two words free wine,1
the price is reasonable although the service is poor,1
the quantity is also very good you will come out satisfied,2
i have been to roths twice and both times were very disappointing,0
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store,2
i stumbled upon this second floor walkup two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from la being serious sushi lovers we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action,1
ragas is a romantic cozy restaurant,2
the fried rice is amazing here,2
three courses choices include excellent mussels puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world,2
its a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food,2
the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious,2
at the end youre left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup,1
i just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money,2
the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach,2
the wine list is excellent,2
so garantuan that you cant fit them in a toaster,0
ive been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before and toons is by far the best thai food ive had except for my moms of course,2
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another,0
i highly recommend the sophia pizza,2
whem asked we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were,1
this is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner,2
nice atmosphere the service was very pleasant and the desert was good,2
all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends,1
after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner,2
fabulous service fantastic food and a chilled out atmosphere and environment,2
not what i wanted to hear,0
try the lasagnette appetizer,1
pricey but worth a try at least once,2
ive been there a few times and i usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people,1
i liked the beer selection,2
great food good size menu great service and an unpretensious setting,2
go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience,1
cant wait to go back,2
i grew up eating dosa and have yet to find a place in ny to satisfy my taste buds,1
wine list selection is good and winebytheglass was generously filled to the top,2
with the great variety on the menu i eat here often and never get bored,2
the menu is very limited i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees,1
if you are a carnivore come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been,2
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent,2
not too crazy about their sake martini,1
great bagels spreads and a good place to hang out in,2
the service varys from day to day sometimes theyre very nice and sometimes not,2
whoever the jazz duo was they were on point,2
one thing i liked about this place is that i never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests,2
this place is a great bargain,2
we happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results,2
unfortunately the food is outstanding but everything else about this restaurant is the pits,0
deff recimmend bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out,1
we always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied,2
dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks swirl them around and eat,1
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace,2
my husbands was perfect my was well done and dry,2
everyone i have spoken too there is super friendly helpful and willing to the extra mile for a customer,2
the pizza was pretty good and huge,2
sapphire is the only indian restaurant i go to when im in nyc,1
the cuisine from what ive gathered is authentic taiwanese though its very different from what ive been accustomed to in taipei,1
i heartily recommend,2
heartland brewery is by far one of the best places in nyc to make new friends and catch up with old ones,2
i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded,2
they are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service,2
all my coworkers were amazed at how small the dish was,2
the atmosphere is unheralded the service impecible and the food magnificant,1
we ordered the special grilled branzino that was so infused with bone it was difficult to eat,0
the wait staff is friendly and the food has gotten better and better,2
this place which is only a few months old is perhaps queens biggest secret,1
it may be a bit packed on weekends but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area,2
this place is so much fun,2
i was glad i did,2
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza,2
ive never been treated so rudely,0
ill be back soon,1
le pere pinard has a 15 pretheater menu that is outstanding,2
went inside and i started to get excited,2
i also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order,0
our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal,1
however it is jus too good to not praise it,2
we have been to montparnasse many times and return often for good reason,2
the strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds,0
we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic,2
its somewhere you can eat and be happy,2
if you wrote a bad review its because you dont understand what raos is all about,0
had we been stalling i could understand where they were coming from but we had been there less than an hour and they hadnt even brought us a check yet,0
though the spider roll may look like a challenge to eat with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll it is well worth the price you pay for them,2
deep fried skewers are good and still rare to find in nyc,2
i have tried to make reservations but both times the hostess didnt have my name,0
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee rice porridge,2
their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for,2
this was one of the best restaurants ive ever been to,2
this restaurant used to be pretty decent,2
an oasis of refinement food though somewhat uneven often reaches the pinnacles of new american fine cuisine chefs passion and kitchens precise execution is most evident in the fish dishes and soups,1
if you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare youll love artisanal,2
i love indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it,2
some baby pizzas get their wish,1
plenty of choices to make your own creation,1
it was tiny and i felt like i was eating in someones living room,1
i was there on sat,1
overall a oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it,2
the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it,2
vt is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up,1
from the terrible service to the bland food not to mention the unaccommodating managers the overall experience was horrible,0
lahore is a great place to duck into latenight when you need some really tasty food on the cheap youll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for four dollars,2
the last time i went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen,1
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end,2
nice restaurant overall with classic upscale italian decor,2
not impressed with the food,0
the entire dining experience was wonderful,2
the wine selection by the glass and bottle is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if theyre going to be in town,2
service is highly refined our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress,2
order the panang duck its fantastic,2
food is usually very good though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders,2
other than the crappy service from two individuals its great,1
what more can you ask for,1
wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment,1
they have authentic indian at amazin prices,2
you are treated just like royality,0
theres nice and quiet small but enough for 6 or more,2
ambiance relaxed and stylish,2
ive never felt more unwelcome than last month at jimmys bronx cafe,0
luckily we saved room for the bbq salmon sea bass and crispy duck,2
yes they use fancy ingredients but even fancy ingredients dont make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right,0
looking from the outside in one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall really thats what it is,1
and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs,2
i look forward to eating here again,2
ive been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste,1
tuk tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price,2
a glass of leaping lizard a glass of prosecco and the mussels had everything happy,2
food was average and creme brulee was awful the sugar was charred not caramelized and smelled of kerosene,0
the food always tastes fresh and served promptly,2
i know because i live nearby,1
the pizza here is delicious,2
my entire family was horrified,0
on a monthly basis my friends and i get together and have a girls night out,1
pizza and garlic knots are great as well i order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick,2
for great chinese food nearby you have wu liang ye and grand sichuan just a block away,2
but who says murrays is anything about service,0
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant the food,0
i have never been disappointed in the red eye,2
hats off to the chef,1
this should have been done in a back room away from customers,1
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things the heavy black antiqueseeming teapot for one in the restaurant experience,2
glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers,1
the pizza is delicious they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap frozen shredded cheese common to most pizzarias,2
its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of new york,2
service is friendly and never had a problem walking in and getting a table,2
the atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistrotype vibe,2
check it out,1
first off the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw herodd in a restaurant with 6 tables and got our order wrong,0
dont go,1
the food was bland oily,0
but they do,1
what is even better is that the prices are very affordable as well and the food is really good,2
the fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary,2
look i dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place please try someother places,0
suan has challenged this loyalty,1
our favorite meal is a pesto pizza the house salad and a good bottle of wine,2
and kruno the beverage manager is the best bartender i have yet to come across,2
ambiance and music funky which i enjoy,2
the food drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city,2
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date,1
its a really great deal considering we got full off of four dollars,2
i understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters you come for the authentic foods the tastes the experiance,1
went with mommy the only person who could afford taking me here,1
my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend,1
last time i went here the waitress didnt come back after taking our order,0
try the tandoori salmon,1
i am completely hooked on this place it is ridiculous,2
eating in the atmosphere saves it but at your desk its a very disappointing experience,0
granted the space is smaller than most it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants,2
have recommended the place to friends always gets good response,2
we will return many times for this oasis in midtown,2
i love the atmorphere peep,2
enjoy,2
we werent,1
this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed,2
la rosa is connected by a swinging door to the mexican restaurant pacifico,1
it could have been handled better,0
the service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark,2
the other night we had the 30 three course meal and everything was delicious if i could of licked the plate clean i would of,2
please be aware that its cash or amex only,1
even after getting pushed out by the noclass famous rays sal has risen again to carry on his fathers uncles legacies with a smile true love for his community and lets not forget the outstanding pizza,2
its a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early,0
the environment is romantic but the food is horrible the service is pathetic and gabriella lies about everything she could,0
we had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well,2
i had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion,2
they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior,2
what came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy,0
i had the pad thai and the noodles were sticky,1
so ive never actually been to m proper but ive had it delivered a few times,1
among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants this offers by far one of the best values for your money,2
frankly when you compare what you can have here for lunch versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city there is no comparison,1
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive,0
if youre craving for harus great food especially the house roll but cant stand the wait building outisde head across the street to their sake bar,2
a narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters a great deal of mess stacks of bottles cans and a small counter holding 1214 entrees,1
the food is great,2
succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired doneness accompanied by salads and sides that dont look like leafy road kill,1
lunch came with pickels and slaw no extra charge,1
decent wine at reasonable prices,2
all conveniently delivered right to the door,2
even the wine by the glass was good,2
nice family owned traditional restaurant,2
would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price,1
this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it,2
i also ordered the change mojito which was out of this world,1
okay service,1
the only thing more wonderful than the food which is exceptional is the service,2
we were very pleasantly surprised,2
the food was just awful atrocious actually,0
i will never visit this restaurant again,0
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water,1
the antipasta was excellent especially the calamari as were the filling pasta mains,2
the waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food,2
or sister in my case,1
ive eaten at many different indian restaurants,1
they might be all business at the counter when you give your order but their food says i love you,2
we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included ceviche mix special crab dumplings assorted sashimi sushi and rolls two types of sake and the banana tempura,2
try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant,1
dont go there,0
ok so the servers wander around a little clueless but theres more than enough servers for the crowd they get its fine you just have to make a small effort to get their attention,2
good luck getting a table,2
we picked it randomly without a recommendation from someone who has been there so we werent sure what to expect,1
dont look down your nose at me like that,0
planet thai is great,2
the service is awful,0
just dont do it,0
just ignore the trendy wannabes,0
the takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes i cant wait,2
trust me it will be great and all of it will be devoured in no time,2
my girlfiends and i ate at og again last night,1
i wish they had one near my office i would go everyday,2
finally,2
amma has the worst value for money i have experienced in nyc over the past 2 years,0
i am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food but my friend who took me there is,1
i think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated,2
regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you five minutes,1
the pizza is good though,2
bottles of wine are cheap and good,2
you will not be disapointed at all,1
walkins are risky too,0
the have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini,2
they didnt give us the dinner special until we asked for it,0
you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert,2
word of advice save room for pasta dishes and never leave until youve had the tiramisu,1
very good service and very good prices,2
i recently went to this restaurant with some coworkers for lunch and had an amazing time,2
the service was impeccable and unobtrusive the staff knows what they are there to do to know their menu present your meal and attend to your needs,2
essabagel either by stytown or midtown is by far the best bagel in ny,2
our food was great too,2
open late well as late as i ever got there and im a night person,1
the most annoying thing though is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue,0
get your food to go find a bench and kick back with a plate of dumplings,1
please try the filet mignon its just the most tender piece ever,2
everything we had was pretty good but we have only been there once,2
we were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria but facing away from the bar when we turned back around the 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it,1
something about them being busy with holiday partys,1
the sake menu should not be overlooked,1
i would highly recommend,2
this place is great,2
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm,2
ive been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes theyre that good,2
with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district is truly an excellent find,2
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn,0
the service wine selection ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition,2
went there last night for 2 year anniversery and wasnt all that impressed,0
it was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us,0
we were seated promptly as we had reservations however after that the service was slow,1
at first i was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of nyc,1
its really also the service is good and the waiters are friendly,2
suan was a recommendation that i am glad we heeded,2
the food was pretty good but a little flavorless and the portions very small including dessert,2
we visit at least once a month,1
it is set far from the small street its on and there is no traffic noise,1
also the place is popular with families so if youre bothered by children running loose like wild animals come later at night to avoid them,0
ill keep this short,1
i felt as though i were eating in paris,1
lived in shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship green bo restaurant there,1
i highly recommend cafe st barts for their food the ambience and wonderful service,2
however its not worth a special trip,0
nice value,2
giginos in wagner park is so enjoyable,2
and it was quick which is very important,2
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates,2
all the nyu students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere,2
the food here does a great service to the name cantonese that is,2
but nothing stands out about the cooking,0
joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful if not relaxed atmosphere,2
if thats a problem go to mcdonalds and destroy your insides,0
the prix fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough both in quantity and quality,2
ive been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city,2
i had their eggs benedict for brunch which were the worst in my entire life i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was,0
i work nearby and they have the best oatmeal in the neighborhood not a packaged or quickcooked item,2
always busy but fast moving,1
too bad the food wasnt of the same heritage,0
the menu looked good except for offering the chilean sea bass but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside,1
sexy,1
the food was really good i had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever,2
i will have to say this bengali fast food joint is clearly my favorite,2
im not picky but it was actually gross,0
overall a solid restaurant and at less than 40pp including wine a solid deal as well,2
since it literally is a complete hole in the wall its a bit intimidating at first but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you dont hesitate to ask for help with what to get,2
based on the reviews for dinner this is a place i would reconsider revisiting for that but definitely not for dim sum again,0
it costs 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an insideout roll but the roll more than triples in size and thats not just from the rice,1
even with johns and joes around the corner this place will make a name for itself,2
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistencynot too fishy creamy and slightly buttery,2
when he finally did he was unable to make a gin and tonic couldnt find tonic,0
my girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite,1
the dim sum is ok but doesnt taste that fresh and the little dishes dont look steamy hot as they should also note lack of chinese here,0
despite the untasteful previous review,0
dont judge this place prima facie you have to try it to believe it a home away from home for the literate heart,1
sure everyones got their favorite but to know sal is to know new york,1
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation,2
also they were 15 each,1
the service is ok some of the people didnt get what they asked for,1
my friends spoke so much about it for months i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in,2
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go,0
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one,1
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree,2
this is as good as neighborhood restaurants come,2
if you want some roast duck pork or chicken on rice with ginger try them out,1
you order from a menu so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience,0
one of the more authentic shanghainese restaurants in the us definitely the best in manhattan chinatown,2
we will go back every time we are in the city,2
we love th pink pony,2
so eat fast and order a lot,1
staff is very accomodating,2
i have to agree with the previous reviewer,2
eat club is a roving group of nyc gluttons,1
if you were there when it first opened give this restaurant a second chance,2
i went to del friscos friday night with my boyfriend for an 800 reservation,1
if you like sakagura but you feel its too much youd better try yokocho,1
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me,1
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date,2
you cant go wrong with this place,2
very popular style izakaya sake and small portion of sakefriendly dishes,2
hurleys is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came,2
not pretentious and very economical,1
the food was terrific and the service classy attentive without being overbearing,2
this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls,2
fresh ingredients and everything is made to order,1
we have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip and the food was delivered quickly but we live only a few minutes walk from them,2
quick and friendly service,2
authentic bistro,1
they are tasty but i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system,1
somewhat pricey but what the heck,0
its true this place is not cheap,1
try the hot dogs too theyre snappy and delicious,2
delivery is fast too,2
being from the south there arent any good delis in my area and while watching foods across america on pbs i found out about katzs deli,0
the noise level was unbearable conversation impossible,0
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights,2
highly recommended is the spicy fried clam rolls and spider rolls,2
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way,1
its convenient,1
thanks blooms for a lovely trip,2
the atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon,2
oh right i should probably say something nice,2
odd for ave b not just odd the place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least,1
when we stumbled on leon we thought that we had found quite the gem but we were certainly wrong,1
instead of wasting your time here support restaurants that care about food,1
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions,1
just got back from lunch at tamarind and it was excellent,2
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st taj mahal is also very comparable in food quality to the much overpraised and underdeserving baluchis,1
the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving mean while there were boths open all around,1
try the cheesecake,1
as we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were,0
david daytona beach fl,1
perhaps,1
great indian food and the service is incredible,2
go here,1
if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave,1
rosarios is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence,2
decor is nice and minimalist food simple yet very well presented and cooked and the wine list matches the food very well,2
i had the salmon dish and while it was fine for the price paid i expected it to have some type of flavor,1
we ordered a tuna melt it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich,1
especially liked chicken tikka and the naan and the dals,2
the waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished,0
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty,2
my wife and i always enjoy the young not always well trained but nevertheless friendly staff all of whom have a story,2
we generally like good restaurants and eat out often but kai was way to expensive for what we got,1
what a great place,2
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day,2
dont eat here unless youre starving for thai food and you work next door,0
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising,2
for the people who want great food plus great service roxy is a place to avoid,0
i had the best ravioli ever,2
while the menu isnt especially groundbreaking everything ive tried so far has been wellexecuted and tasty,2
ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding,2
the bill is approximately 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks,1
quite frankly this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried,0
the food is great service is ok,2
the overall price tag was very very expensive something i did expect,0
by the time we were done it was past 100am,1
spice is great thai food love the inexpensive appetizers,2
read all the other review theyll confirm it,1
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there,0
the service was attentive,2
he not only makes his own homemade mozzarella but every pie is ultra fresh,2
fish was overdone,0
great idea and base for restaurant but work on the details people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like,2
when youre sitting in their main dining room which has a spectacular handpainted high ceiling youd never know there was a world outside,2
we visited bread bar during january restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service,2
i have been twice to this restaurant,1
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in quite a weird selection,1
you could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other french bistros,1
the establishment scores big points in presentation and style,2
the rest of the dim sum though pricey by chinatown standards is worth it,2
good food,2
the wait staff is very friendly if not overly efficient,2
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth,1
the dim sum however was very good,2
its better than being on the roof of sutton place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night,0
service has always been friendly and efficient,2
went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers,1
its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch,2
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner,1
the table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived,1
prices are very good,2
we could not catch our waiters eye and he ignored us,0
fantastic place,2
plain and simple its bad thai food,0
definitely not a restaurant to skip,0
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends,0
usually 3 vs 4 items per dish,1
while certain staples are excellent the burger some of the pastas the food is not really the point,1
the dim sum was soso but not spectacular,0
the food was soso,2
the waitress seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing,0
the place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints and has a bar which deserves a mention,2
what a ripoff,0
threw my fiances surprise 30th birthday dinner here couldnt be happier,2
you can do it here,2
foodawesome,2
good music great food speedy service affordable prices,2
there was a small wait but shorter than i expected,1
the lobster sandwich is 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price,0
may the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you,2
ive lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all,2
i just read mocaramels review and felt compelled to respond,1
the sides were ok and incredibly salty,1
it hits the spot every time,2
for some reason all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the salmon,0
not a large place but its cute and cozy,2
dont be fooled by crowds of people,1
and theres no way out,1
the beverages were excellent and the dessert was good,2
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out,0
next time we wouldnt dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks,1
please if your thinking about it go and stay the wait you wont be disappointed,1
i must say the view of nyc is so beautiful,2
if youd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent long tan is a good place on the slope,2
when going out for a nice dinner i like a nice ambiance as well as very good food,2
for all you lazy folks that dont want to come to alphabet city i say good stay out,0
otherwise this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere,2
highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service,2
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service,2
a the service was good to excellent along with the attitude,2
this is my fourth try over a two year period and im done,1
the food is awesome definitely try the striped bass,2
the music does get a little loud at times but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife and as i did i got a whiff of corriander,2
black white shakes came out good also,2
its simply the best meal in nyc,2
probably would not go again,0
after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner,1
the seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here,1
i ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken,1
we go on mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to blue ribbon,1
tuk tuk is my second favorite neighborhood thai place the first being joya,2
however theyve got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot,2
great bagels made the oldfashioned way,2
this is some really good inexpensive sushi,2
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread but all the bagles are unbeliavably good,2
i wouldnt even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy too,0
for the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated,1
the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc,2
also good for client lunch meetings esp,2
for 600 the most we have ever paid not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance,1
the decor is dark cool and soothing while the foods presentation is spectacular considering the low prices,2
the waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal,2
the setting is casual and romantic,2
it was horrible,0
terrible terrible management deserves to be shutdown,0
great friendly service fast seating fast delivery excellent sushi,2
the desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced french restaurants,2
the italian food has flavor that can be sort of surprising on the ues and the service turns from a nightmare to attentivethey sort of remind me of the ny yankees of the late 90s no matter how bad it look you knew that there was a rally just around the corner,1
as many other reviewers noticed your order is often slow to arrive this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time,1
i found the food to be outstanding particulary the salmon dish i had,2
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else,2
the new york times has reviewed this place three times already you know its going to be good,2
baluchis has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices,2
emilio the owner is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go,1
i have been to spice three times twice during lunch and once at dinner,1
moules were excellent lobster ravioli was very salty,2
i came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged,0
a cheap eat for nyc but not for dosa,1
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can,0
the seafood is amazing theres a good wine list and the everchanging menu always offers some great surprises,2
i dont usually order wine with indian so i cant comment on their wine list or their wines,1
pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high ask for extra rye bread,2
200 for 2 glasses of champagne not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks,2
really though wheres the seasoning,1
the food was just ok at least for what food was available,2
by dinner time they turn it around and mount a huge comeback,2
the waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal,2
the ambience was nice but service wasnt so great,0
solid wine list knowledgeable staff friendly owners and an adventurous everchanging menu keep us coming back,2
the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes,2
we didnt even see a menu as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes,1
the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it,2
otherwise good stuff for late nite eats,2
the dinner was ok nothing i would have again,2
it is thick and slightly soggy,1
its not the same if you have to sit inside,0
i love and i know gourmet food by excellence,2
i plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta paninis,2
great people watching as others do the same to you,2
maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but ive experienced the same with other restaurants so i dont appreciate such practice,0
two people in our party felt like something else and volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu,2
he offers subpar service and has no personality,0
the waitress remembers me and is very friendly she knows what my regular is and thats the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd,2
im going back,1
diner food at bistro prices is a bummer,0
my friends and i have been going here regularly for two years,1
wow how have i missed this one tried long tan last week for the first time and now know what the ny times and many more in the neighborhood already knew,1
go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby veal calfok bad joke but you will see,0
while we thoroughly enjoyed the food it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation,1
me and my girls will definitely go back,2
the first time the sushi was outstanding the second time it was a little bland,1
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter,2
delicious bagels especially when right out of the oven,2
ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in,1
all the food was hot tasty,2
have been several times and it never dissapoints,1
this is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for takeout pizza,1
our server was very helpful and friendly,2
try green curry with vegetables,1
would recommend this place as a good date spot if you dont want to drop a ton of cash,2
while im not sure that this happens all the timethis is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business,1
this place was not all that,0
first of all this place is not romantic as claimed by citysearchs editorial review,0
the second you walk through the heavy vault like door with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime,2
much more reasonably priced too,2
if you venture off the island of manhattan and cant seem to find a great italian restaurant drive to corona,1
the food was not very tasty the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant,0
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian,2
others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until theyre eaten,0
why make a reservation if you arent going to keep it,1
the pad thai is excellent here as well,2
big and gawky on the outside,1
i have been to marys many times and i like it,2
searching to get out from the cold freezing weather we went into what we thought was a deli,1
i do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant,0
highly recommended,2
this is the best thing in soho,2
went here last night and had a pleasant experience,2
we parked on the block of ninas the place looked nice with people obviously enjoying their pizzas,2
i came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend,2
for 760 for 2 people its a once in a lifetime experience,2
the food is ok but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant,0
we had the potstickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great,2
i think the stuff was better than disney,2
after reading the good reviews of this restaurant i decided to give it a try with two friends,2
while the 20 entree range is not overly expensive in new york city there is definitely better food in that range and so sapphire despite its lovely atmosphere will most likely not be a restaurant to which i will return,2
orsay is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic french food in nyc,2
i had been searching really hard for a restaurant in new york where i could really feel unwanted and ignored and i finally found it,0
its definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone,0
well their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold,0
the staff is no nonsense,1
chinese desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness,2
wonderful at holiday time,2
and really large portions,1
the place is a lot of fun,2
this is a great thai restaurant with a very friendly staff,2
have eaten at ginger house several times and its always good,2
i ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor,0
we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday and i was thoroughly impressed with the food,2
i recommend the garlic shrimp okra bindi and anything with lamb,2
as a japanese native ive lived in the tristate area for over 8 years but i was just so amazed at this place,2
to give you an idea of how good we thought it was we ended up going to pings three weekends in a row,2
as we were leaving the couple standing by the door said to another waiter were not in a hurry,1
the menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger to steak to escargot,2
in fact two people could really share one plate,1
the food is great and authentic,2
this was a repeat visit and well definitely be back again,2
during happy hour,2
good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers,2
love yuka,2
anyway the food is good the price is right and they have a decent wine list,2
go go hurry before everyone finds out about it,1
prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good,2
i am bringing my whole family back next time,2
this place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing,2
the photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look,2
the food was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny,0
but the coconut rice was good,2
it took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer,1
a guaranteeed delight,2
i have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years,1
overall i would recommend it and go back again,2
the food was great,2
pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list,2
if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then youll love it here,2
all of my coworkers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadnt heard about this place,2
anyway this is the last time i cross the williamsburg,1
metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal,2
friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company youre with,2
when im feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office i head for cafe st barts,0
guess the 555soul ads didnt launch her big modeling career,0
the restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly,2
besides we were on vacation,1
i love this cozy around the way rest,2
quality of food is excellent and price is cheap stick to pork fish chicken lamb and vegetables,2
dont leave without trying one night in tokyo,1
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one,0
this is my favorite italian restaurant in all of new york city,2
the place is a little tight and on a cold day the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty,0
the appetizing is excellent just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price if bought by the pound,2
but they were too big for the bun,0
the food is fresh delicious and reasonably priced,2
raga stands out with an interesting fusion of french and indian cooking,2
a few tips skip the turnip cake roast pork buns and egg custards,1
the bagels are fabulous,2
oh yes and they lie on the phone claiming they have seating in the garden then of course the seats are not available,0
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat,2
the food was very good a great deal and the place its self was great,2
the food options rule,1
a great choice at any cost and a great deal,2
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet where greasy dry and tasteless are complimentary,0
we ate here in march 2006 and ordered the pretheatre 3course dinner with wine flight,1
definately check it out,1
probably much busier for lunch its seldom crowded for dinner too close to downtown,1
their calzones are horrific bad vomitinducing yuck,0
it takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something although they dont forget to charge you for it,0
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening,2
saturday nov 6th i had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us,2
good spreads great beverage selections and bagels really tasty,2
first the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials which i would have chosen had i known about them,1
we will be back,2
also top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu,2
it seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too,2
check out the secret back room,1
its also attached to angels share which is a cool more romantic bar,2
authentic food and they have real service not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door,1
stick to the gulab jamun,1
i am amazed by the poor reviews i find this place to be standout italian in an area flooded with italian great prices great atmosphere good service and a wonderful wine list,2
i was backtoback with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again,1
with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room,2
i was a little leary about marys at first its small crowded and you usually have to wait on line but im glad i finally tried it,2
we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem,2
also very inexpensive,2
weve only eaten in the restaurant once but we have ordered many times for dinner,1
i got enough reasons to keep coming back,2
by far this is the only chinese desserts place i know in ny or anywhere close in the northeastern america that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar,2
the food is great and reasonably priced,2
the characters really make for an enjoyable experience,2
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine,2
over the years the host vittorio and his crew have always treated me as familyalthough with all the business this notsolittle gem does it amazing hes even able to remember a consistent but notsofrequent visitor,2
the restuarant itself is not large but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic taiwanese,1
my husband said he couldve eaten several more the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had,2
you cannot go wrong with this place,1
it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late raucus dinner,2
the food is delicious from the specials to the regular menufare the dishes are never a disappointment,2
prices are in line,1
the combination of fresh tomato sauce fresh mozz cheese basil and the dough they make with imported flour makes this is one of the better pizzas in ny,2
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently,2
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune,0
for all of you new to indian food try the paneer roll it is a piece of heaven,2
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates,2
both the fresh mozzerella slices and the plain cheese slice are phenomenal,2
i have tried literally every restaurant on curry row,1
the food is terrible and overall i would have to say avoid at all costs,0
ive been to this monster sushi twice the 46th st once the 23rd st one a number of times,1
unfortunately the food was not something to get worked up about,0
its constantly open catering to the pakistani cabbies lined up on crosby st so theres more turnover with the food than youd expect ie surprisingly fresh,2
i had filet mignon with garlic mash,1
i went at 600 pm specifically for the pretheater menu 1995 for roasted tomato soup with chevre steak frites creme brulee and it was marvelous,2
the waitstaff were attentive polite and helpful an impressive feat in such close quarters,2
go inside and you wont want to leave,1
i loving bringing friends here and i do so every chance i get,2
the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes however be warned that the peters favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top like a salad,2
yes the prices are high but i felt it was worth it,2
the large selection of bruschettas paninis tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating,1
have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners,2
while this isnt classical restaurant fare the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burnouts,2
the owner truly caters to all your needs,2
he takes real pride in his food and his business,2
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street,2
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent,2
so if you want a nice enjoyable meal at montparnasse go early for the pretheater prixfixe,2
over the years it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine,2
i would go back tho,1
the photobook menu was a cute touch certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken pork chop and noodle dishes that we all ordered,2
too large for just two people but nothing was left,0
i cannot imagine better indian food in all of the city,2
great romantic place for a date try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close,2
a pleasant surprise,2
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere,0
if you dont mind all that noise then go to the chart house,1
we got most of it back at home with us,1
get there before 7pm,1
very good breads as well,2
if this happens just ask for real naan,1
we were fans of the halfprice saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit,1
so if yo really dont care who is sittingnext to you which is about 2 inches away i would say try it,1
pizza is terrific as is homemade pasta,2
definitely a neighborhood favorite,2
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money,2
my first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend,1
example is the soup which was about 6 oz for 12 dollars and the mushrooms where 12 for about 1oz,1
service is not exactly five star but thats not really a big deal,1
there are other people waiting,1
from beginning appetizers the scallops were incredible to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet we were delighted by the taste sensations,2
ou must try this restaurant,2
we left never to return,1
consistently good japanese tapas,2
no apologies during restaurant week,1
my goodness everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing,2
this place started off a little iffy but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in nyc and im indian so i should know,2
they also do a great job for restaurant week,2
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently,1
the dishes offered were unique very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages sardines with biscuits large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream the best and freshest ive ever had,2
this is where the aforementioned line was,1
the food is reliable and the price is moderate,2
aside from the bearded courdoroy blazer professor type with the nyu student hes sleeping with that week you see a strange mix of hipsters frat boys will smith types who need to be told they are black bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet,0
while the ambiance and atmosphere were great the food and service could have been a lot better,2
we always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied,2
i dont how this place is still running,0
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile,2
we were in search of food and stumbled on this block of indian restaurants on east sixth street,1
planet thailand has always been a hit with me i go there usually for the sushi which is great the thai food is excellent too,2
very excited to hear that shortterm chef jason narone has moved on he truly was a low point of their sterling track record,2
excellent experience,2
well worth the trip close to city hall and downtown subway stops,2
i had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive,0
what more could you want,2
if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained this is a great place to go and eat,2
all in all i dont see how you can go wrong,1
the sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they dont skimp,2
we recently decided to try this location and to our delight they have outdoor seating perfect since i had my yorkie with me,2
my husband had the mesclun salmon and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses,2
we were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 800 pm curtain call,1
the food is usually good but it certainly isnt a relaxing place to go,0
im told that it is open 24hrs which is good,2
super friendly and knowledgable staff fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz the chilaquiles were awesome,2
the prices were fantastic,2
what a great place,2
still any quibbles about the bill were offset by the pouryourown measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house,1
the table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry i understood they were busy,1
its not mindblowing but to me thai food never is and never will be,0
food was very good as well considering that we tried the budget selection though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer so that fat was more of a meltinyourmouth experience,2
although one night we went it was super cheesy and another night it was less cheesy,1
even though it is a little loud you dont have to yell at each other to talk,1
ive been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine if not good,1
it is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but its still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner,2
was surprisingly disappointed,0
i love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap,2
nicky the nose at the bar is a treat,2
i went to ruby foos after work with a group of 6,1
im amazed we havent been kicked out of this place yet,0
service was prompt friendly and great,2
i havent eat a lamb chop as delicious as thatthe salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil,2
the sushi was awful,0
katzs has been a nyc original for over 100 years,1
you can get an excellent meal at most of the many indian restaurants on nearby lexington avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here,2
the pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down it was a pleasurable experience,2
the plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroomthird generationfornini pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle again making it soggy and nothingon the rest,0
late nite omelletes are not good here there is no variety,0
everything at sala thai is tasty and wellportioned,2
after all that they complained to me about the small tip,0
its a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner,2
behind this counter two men are squeezed in,1
great find,2
if only they delivered theyd make a mint,1
whenever you need a sushi fix mizu will be there with quality fish and great service,2
our waitress was sweet and accomodating not overbearing,2
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them,1
i was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there,0
the website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing,0
despite a slightly limited menu everything prepared is done to perfection ultra fresh and a work of food art,2
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful,2
a large is 20 and toppings are about 3 each,1
in any event this is a place ill be sure to stop by again when im in this part of town,2
i definitely wouldnt go back,0
it is not worth for that bucks,0
brick oven gallery is my pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere,2
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening,2
for many people this may not seem like aunthentic thai food because most places in nyc arent quite authentic,0
growing up in ny i have eaten my share of bagels,1
oh dont even let me start with how expensive the bills were,0
a hearty two thumbs up,2
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary,2
all the appetizers and salads were fabulous the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious,2
besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated we were served dishes we hadnt ordered three times received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served and that order was undercooked and charged 45 more than we should have been on our bill,0
service is top notch,2
the food now is inconsistent,0
all pretty good,2
you can also special order any kind of dumplingetc,1
you guys rock,2
chance is a joke,0
i was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer,2
be careful before you request extra spice,1
the octopus eaters were floored by the octopus salad,0
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods,0
i was at raos last wed,1
and the tom kha soup was pathetic,0
i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two,2
the decor is vibrant and eyepleasing with several semiprivate boths on the right side of the dining hall which are great for a date,2
service was quick,1
tends to turn people away,0
we thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like,1
i was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine and have been going back regularly ever since,2
drawbacks service is slow and they dont toast,0
went there for an office lunch,1
i have been doing all of the above at the heartland brewery for over 5 years now and i have never been disappointed,2
everytime i decide to try another place on the ues i get angry that i didnt just go to zucchero pomodori,0
the sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable,2
weve been following chef lyles food around new york for 15 years and while remaining classic his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return,2
the best thing i tasted were the lambchops,2
its delicious,2
the spicy tuna and salmon are the best weve ever had,2
even though its good seafood the prices are too high,0
in addition the food is very good and the prices are reasonable,2
upon entering we were greeted by the owners steven and frederick who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts,2
if you live outside the neighborhood dont bother,1
been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably,0
meat dishes now adorn the selections although theres still a large number of vegetarianfriendly choices,2
i never had anything i didnt like here,0
reasonable prices,1
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration,2
try the crunchy tuna it is to die for,1
it wont break the bank but i also wouldnt come back for the food,0
all in all this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city,2
ive been to joya twice and i will never go again,0
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary,0
however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town,1
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects,2
if youre looking for perfect traditional sushi go here if youre looking for interesting combinations try sushi of garis east side,2
no refills on fountain drinks though,1
wow over 100 beers to choose from,2
be careful of portions theyre huge,1
the steak tartare is a great bet they fix it for you at the table,2
my first time there i happened not to like the crab croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal,1
great for large groups and celebrations our super happy waiter was the entertainment of the evening,2
did i mention the wine,1
plus on wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited,2
it is by far my favorite restaurant in brooklyn,2
now its so crowded and loud you cant even talk to the person next to you,0
love pizza 33,2
even my indian friend couldnt believe how good and tasty everything was,2
im from england and harus was the best i had in nyc,2
less more in their case,1
ruby foos is a tourist trap,0
ive been here a couple of times and have not been impressed,0
ive been many time and have never been disappointed,1
ciao bella,1
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan,1
the dim sum servings here are a bit larger than im used to,1
however in the summer of 2003 it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup,1
we wont go to this place again for a good meal,0
its a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street,2
barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist as if poached yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning a spice rub might have overwhelmed however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance,2
we were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant,0
after dinner take your date to the huge dance floor probably one of the biggest youll see in ny,2
taj mahal offeres gret value and great food,2
has the chef and owner changed,1
my boyfriend and i recently had an early dinner at artisanal and was satisfied with our experience,2
i absolutely loved this place,2
i wish i lived there as i would eat at this place as often as possible,2
but dont ever order bacon late at nite either platter or in sandwiches for that matter dont from any take out place as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos hurt my molars,0
outstanding bagels but you get what you pay for,2
pizza the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings the crust tastes like the best freshly baked bread,2
if youre in town its worth searching for another place,1
i have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one,2
i found it on a cold night the perfect spot to warm up,2
they even have a section in the menu called american chinese food,1
service was warm and attentive beef carpaachio was exellent huge portion and pasta was fresh and wellprepared,2
kalbi and nebbiolo do work together,1
best italian food i ever had and being italian that means alot,2
i will recommend scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful italian food,2
located at the end of a magnificent block,2
this restaurant is not worth the time effort or money to say the least,0
looking around i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen,2
keep up the good work guys,2
hurleys is terrific,2
they dont walk around with the trays of dim sum,1
took my sister here before attending a show one evening,1
great bar most gorgeous bartenders youve ever seen specifically the blond lady,2
we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order,1
really,1
i really loved the different and inovated touch thats the cheff gives to the food,2
our friends have not arrived yet,1
they came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant,0
i had a terrific meal and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasnt as good,2
the svc can be a bit rude at times esp if you have big group but overall the restaurant is a must,0
my husband and i thougt it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary and to our surprise it was fantastic,2
never once did i leave feeling unwelcome or impressed,0
the food is good especially their more basic dishes and the drinks are delicious,2
but the main hit was the whole grilled fish,1
i had the tuna tartare with sake mushroom ravioli with pinot noir and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for 49,1
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch,2
the food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service,2
i usually go there later at night when i get off work so i dont have to deal with crowds or lines,1
pizza here is consistently good,2
we had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for,2
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away we hadnt even looked at it yet we had full beers yet to drink the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations,1
wouldnt recomend it for dinner,1
sauce was watery and the food didnt have much flavor,0
my husband and i enjoy sangria,2
but after last night spice grill is the only place im eating indian cuisine,1
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh,2
first the wrong bread came out with the appetizer then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course,0
not sure where the previous reviewer lonk dined but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food,2
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food this is one of the best spots,2
tell them herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter,1
make reservations but expect to be delayed 1520 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square,0
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes,2
they dont seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai,1
other apetizers and food,1
the noodle and rices dishes taste great,2
the foods as good as ever,2
the crust is thin the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly,2
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem,2
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place,0
the food was undercookedthe sauce watery and the vegetables raw,0
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make em worth eating,1
the sauces used are also not that exciting,0
the secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered,2
i absolutely love this place,2
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard,0
we had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses,2
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful,2
i am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort,0
when my dessert came there was a candle in it not because anyone asked for one but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort,1
i got the 10 10piece dim sum combo every bite of which was great,2
there are other vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those,1
there is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times,0
if its just a quick martini at the bar which i recommend jefferys or a mind blowing roast chicken go to village,2
no thanks,1
there was a long wait for a table outside but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice,2
i would definently recommend this restaurant,2
the prices are wonderfully low,2
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo,1
i love this place,2
i have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials,2
so much more than the usual bar food go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their handcrafted beers,2
a big disappointment all around,0
and its absolutely delicious,2
no free drink,1
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i cant not mention or undermine,1
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent,2
definitely highly not recommended,0
while they keep the capex to a minimum they do put some cash into the bagels because they among the best in the city,2
i had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of,2
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place,1
dont waste money on decor,0
they also have a back garden open in the summer cute and french with outdoor seating what more could you ask for,2
go to any corned indian restaurant and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme,1
i have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri,1
given the incredible architecture surrounding it this place has no character,1
id call it an italian dinner,1
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary,1
while the place is not a hotspot hangout the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck,2
i have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls night,2
have frequented ino for several years and the food remains excellent,2
their eggplant is so delicate sweet tender,2
i pray it stays open forever,2
each bite of food at kai was indeed delicious fresh and elegant,2
all the food was excellent considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it,2
if you want to save some money dont go here,0
my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better,2
i had the cod with paella spicy and very filling im a big eater and could only eat half while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips again a big serving at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries,2
its a shame that a nice convenient place like the pink pony can be so ruined by lousy service,0
this is the first time citysearch didt call it right,0
you should pass on the calamari,1
the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless so was the seafood tagliatelle,0
try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps,1
the food portions are really large,1
the fries are yummy,2
friendly and informative staff very attentive and prompt raw bar service,2
best taiwanese food in ny,2
i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst,0
this place is a great stop for great food,2
all the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that i have had in the city,2
what for,1
fantastic,2
they were dry and disgusting i didnt even finish my first piece,0
highly recommended for a first date,2
we laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip which was generous i feel,2
and the prices were way to high for what you get,0
but people from sichuan will die for it chongqing hot pot chongqing was the biggest city of sichuan now became an independent province,0
skip baroanda down the street eurotrashy snooty and expensive and check this place out,1
skip this location and go to the one in soho,1
the staff ignored my friends and i the entire time we were there,0
yet paired with such rude service would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there,0
i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends and spent three enjoyable hours there,2
the inhouse lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music and moreover takes requests,2
i need at least three rolls to be full and thats at least 1400,1
anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment,0
all of it was simply amazing unique and tasty and best of all it didnt break the bank,2
great wine list reasonably pricedsara,2
the hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale,0
while the food was excellent it wasnt cheap though not extremely expensive either,2
beef noodle soup is good as well,2
i was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got,0
delivery service is great too,2
the foods dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate truly embracing the beauty of authentic thai cuisine,2
i recieved prompt service with a smile,2
they pray to their food gods to make them into a good pizza like vts,1
the place was quiet and delightful,2
molto bene,1
the best ive found outside of the chinatown masters,2
they are amazing,2
avoid this place,0
the food is a diamond in rough the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes,2
a must try,1
as much as i like the food there i cant bring myself to go back,0
it looked like shredded cheese partly done still in strips,1
the prices and ambience are especially great considering its in the west village,2
the soup is pretty good too,2
it is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in nyc with a weeks notice,2
i have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme and this chef accomplishes without fats,2
if you go to roths try to be served by mike he is great,2
based on a visit a month ago i returned the week before christmas and was hugely disappointed,0
went here on a friends reccomendation,1
not the food not the ambiance not the service i agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out,0
i love essabagel but i live on the west side so i often go to murrays for convenience,2
i always get the shabushabu dinner and the beef is always fresh,2
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasnt even fully melted,0
we were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a sunday night,2
nha trang while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals is one of the best vietnamese restaurants ive ever been to the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables,2
on the other hand if you are not fooled easily you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with alain ducasse and food that will outshine in presentaion taste choice quality and quantity,2
we will definitely go back,2
i live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of the pizza place at 3am,1
is just the way it was in days gone by,1
if i could rate the people this place would be off the charts unfortunately the pizza sorry not the best in nyc,0
the food is amazing,2
having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues,2
the portions are now very small the sauces are overlyambitious usually inedible while the service is still good the restaurant due to its popularity seems frantic,2
for the price you cannot eat this well in manhattan,0
the owner is very friendly and a great guy go try his pizza youll like it,2
the atmosphere is great,2
it can be a very fun experience with a group and kids 6 and over would love it,2
with so many good restaurants on the uws i dont need overpriced food absurdly arrogant waitstaff who dont recognize they work at a glorified diner clumsy service and management that doesnt care,0
i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin which was heavenly at sushi rose,2
the service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives,1
the bruscetta is a bit soggy but the salads were fresh included a nice mix of greens not iceberg all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen,2
and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful,2
the atmosphere isnt the greatest but i suppose thats how they keep the prices down,1
the pickles were great addition,2
if your favorite chinese food is general tao chicken then this is not your place,0
you must try the shrimp appetizers,2
not only is the cuisine the best around the service has always been attentive and charming,2
filled with suits though so you never really feel terribly comfortable,1
the production is a symphony alot of fun to experiencethe food sublime for the most part,2
waiters tend to forget drinks completely food portions are so tiny two people have trouble sharing one entree,0
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and wouldnt miss roxys food is expensive but its new york,2
its like you are transported to the italian countryside very romantic and filled with antiques,2
the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan,1
just go and see for yourself,1
the restaurant was packed at first so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated,1
interesting selection good wines service fine fun decor,2
i hate this,0
any if you have a reservation youll wait for max 5 minutes so have a drink at the bar,1
whether its the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite,1
that place was awesome sally,2
the food at this place is gourmet indian cuisine,2
finally a reliable chinese restaurant,2
get over it,0
but the thing that my wife and i hated was it was so loud and it felt like bar or pub,0
however it just so happens that theres an even more amazing place just down the street,2
while there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich katzs has a charm about it,2
however looking at the table next to ours we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza which looked perrrrrrrrrfect,2
priced at upper intermediate range,1
the fish was adequate but inexpertly sliced,1
i recommend ordering in on a weeknight,2
if you live in new york city youll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount,2
try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel,1
while its not nobu it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full,2
so my husband made up an excuse so we can leave,1
its very spicy but not offensive,1
they didnt disappoint service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table,2
i dont know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer,0
the rice to fish ration was also goodthey didnt try to overpack the rice,2
they used shredded cheese on top,1
they are located in the middle of chinatown,1
the food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices,2
eating at ottimo is like eating in chef salvatore espositos home,1
katzs deli is a great ny experience,2
check it out,1
the only positive was the wait staff which was prompt knowledgable and likeable,2
i couldnt reccommend their godmother pizza any higher,0
i am not a vegetarian but almost all the dishes were great,2
i was very impressed by this lowkey upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine,2
i would go again if i didnt have to pay,1
for the location the prices are very reasonable,2
the food is okay and the prices here are mediocre,2
my friends food was also the complete opposite of what its supposed to taste like and look like,0
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime,1
i would like to return and try some of the other menu items when i dont have to rush off to a show,2
we have been to this place many times and always have great food wine and service,2
hopefully next time i will save room for dessert,2
alain ducasse is the best of everything i mean everything was excelenti,2
not a typical pizza joint but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner,2
the corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth,1
go here,1
the best chicken pad tai ive ever had,2
we werent even at our table for more than an hour total,1
20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten,1
it has been my first choice ever since i discovered it,2
over 100 different choices to create your own,1
haru serves very fresh fish has a trendy modern ambiance prime location on park avenue south and friendly service,2
warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months,2
very romantic fires ive literally spent hours at lanterna drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience,2
we got a little tipsy from the sake but isnt that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about,1
i almost wanted to write a bad review so no one would ever go here and i could have all the dumplings to myself,0
after reading the posts i was always skeptical to go to the minnow despite living in park slope,0
i loved it and will be back soon,2
always a nice crowd but never loud,2
my turkey burger was not cooked at all my friends salmon was completely raw,0
the service is spotty sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there,0
decor is minimalist and clean nothing to distract or commend,1
his drinks are very inventive delicious and classy,2
great food great prices great service,2
this isnt your corner chinese food takeout,0
awsome pizza especially the margheritta slice,2
this place however has a lot less pretension than joya and the thai food is still aboveaverage,2
my husband and i ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokenicom,1
try ordering from the regular menu then you would not regret,1
told us to sit anywhere and when we sat he said the table was reserved,1
uni from maine vs california sea vs freshwater eel to get a good taste comparison,1
we started with lox and mussels the best ive ever had ever and had the cod and trout for dinner,2
the crispy chicken wasnt for us though,0
just awsome,2
food is great,2
there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me,2
i recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal,2
this place is incredibly tiny,0
i will definetely go back again and again thats for sure,2
i didnt complain i liked the atmosphere so much,2
this is one of our alltime favorite,2
in reality to maximize potential diners they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby,1
the wine is always good the tapas are always yummy especially with the warm pita bread,2
but when you are seated the waitresses are great they explain everything on the menu and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get,2
this place is amazingly bad,0
compared to other shabu restaurants around town this places wins handsdown,2
ive been to several places for dim sum and this has got to be the worst,0
i love this place,2
the freshest best variety and the fastest delivery,2
go to volare for 1st class service and terrific food,2
its supertrendy and theres always someone to take that empty seat so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence,0
dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time,1
the people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud,0
the sandwiches are dry tasteless and way overpriced,0
the problem is just thatit is a sometimes kind of affair,0
price no more than a jersey deli but way better,2
the fried rice is really good too,2
we were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager tony gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections,2
made my dining experience uncomfortable,0
its a steal,0
we went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments,1
still stay away the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer,1
i was with a party of 7 close but not next the the front doors and we were eating with our coats on,1
a very inviting restaurant with friendly service,2
the back garden sitting area is very pleasant where you can see their personal herb garden,2
whats the difference between the two,1
will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings,1
good french restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless youre into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at katz deli or mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants,1
i was very disappointed with this restaurant,0
the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced,2
we also had shared a house salad that was fresh,2
the ceiling is amazing,2
my wife and i were in nyc celebrating our 30th anniversary,2
im glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny,2
and at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water,0
not a small feat for good french food in the area,2
the space is a bit too small for live music so on jazz nights it can be loud and cramped,0
food was average but tasty,1
we come from new jersey to eat at kinoko,1
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment,1
will never be back,0
the entree was bland and small dessert was not inspired,0
i highly recommend it,2
oh and its too tiny for families with strollers,0
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york,2
with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering the food here was decent not great,0
the pad thai lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but ive had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places,2
delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door,2
my picks guizhou chicken fish with hot bean source fish fillet in spicy source special menu,1
overall im still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again its chinatown,2
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm but the open kitchen is part of the charm,2
my six year old loved it,2
pizza was a little soggy,0
the food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri sevpuri and samosa chaats as well as other great indian appetizers,2
the singapore mai fun had no curry flavor whatsoever,0
the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent,0
the wine list is interesting and has many good values,2
murray wont do it,0
im still mad that i had to pay for lousy food,0
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location,1
definite go if youre used to good indian restaurant food from abroad,2
thr at moshphere is compact modern yet cozy,2
by far the best pizza in manhattan,2
decent thai food in cute though a bit dank little nolita hangout but service terrible,0
most people eat there seem to be typical upper east side snobs so be aware,0
the waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away,0
the food is mostly made from scratch fresh and well prepared,2
worse of all 60 was erroneously added to our 80 bill,0
too cold to enjoy,0
no more reservations expensive tips and annoying stuff,0
try the sea bass,1
20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality i even took a friend here from japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the us that he has been to,2
i brought some buddies from ca and they loved it,2
inside is a little cramped but to be expected,1
sushi wasnt anything spectacular for the price,0
during our meal the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks,2
but they dont have a toaster which is strange,0
so for good food id recommend it but not for a fun night out,1
the menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked,0
a must for all the dosa lovers,2
the portions are huge so it might be good to order three things to split rather than one appetizer and entree per person for two people,1
the appetizers are just ok and the main courses were decidedly subpar,0
someone else recommended the dessert we also left that,1
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations,2
the staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table,2
if you are a vegetarian this really isnt a good place to go,0
try the mediterranean salad it is a true experience for your taste buds,2
im sure ill return for a final judgement tho,1
of course it is crowded but who cares,0
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list,2
ive been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences,2
people are always friendly,2
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee,2
from the entrees to the sides to the drinks everything was creatively prepared yet still simple,1
hmmm,1
service was prompt and courteous,2
it was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap undercooked beef,0
chance is a small cozy restaurant with a romantic feel to it the decor is great,2
it was nice and fresh but i cant give it high scores on being authentic thai,0
overall worht every penny,1
when i called this morning i didnt think i would be able to get in at 12 but i was able to get in along with four other guests,1
got club soda filled with ice no lime,1
only wine and beer are served but the house varities are actually quite good,2
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build,0
my mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant,2
i havent been to the other locations,1
oh and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough yummy,2
people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans,1
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap,2
knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average,0
we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks,1
decent wine selection too,2
go with a group of friends and you will have a great time,2
it saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy crowded bar at dinnertime,1
i have to say i have never had a disapointing meal here,1
its one of our favorite places to eat in ny,2
the place does get crowded so i recommend going between 45 pm,2
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta raddichio was kind of bitter though,2
disappointing food lousy service,0
im from sichuan this is the restaurant i recommend going,2
this lovely frenchasian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on smith street,2
if you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service this is the place,2
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer,2
but this place is a welloiled machine so they know what theyre doing,1
over price and small portions,1
meanwhile the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil gratis,2
but id go back,1
stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting,1
the food was well prepared and the service impecable,2
but their best dish is thh thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp a dish that would cost 2395 is most places but it is 16 here,2
good dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch,2
my husband said the portions were very small but if my main course was good to eat the portion wouldve been fine for me,2
but the thai is definitely not great bland and indistinguished,0
this thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from sripraphai another delicious thai restaurant,2
great for groups great for a date great for early brunch or a nightcap,2
authentic shanghai style and i cannot recommend a better shanghai place in new york,2
our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese,2
perhaps the last reviewer who stated she was treated with attitude lives in a parallel universe because i have never had anything but a perfect experience at yasuda,2
that said i thought scalini fedeli was one of the best dining experiences ive ever had,2
everything about this restaurant was special,2
because we didnt have a reservation we could only sit in the back garden but it was great secluded and perfect in nice weather,2
stuffing yourself with japanese food is a rare thing,1
i try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited,1
while the food was good certainly no il mulino the service was horrendous,0
it is expensive but well worth the money,2
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category,0
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant,2
i would recommend reservations on weekends though,1
there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is 1,1
great pizza for lunch place,2
the food was very expensive we spent 160 for lunch for two but extremely tasty,2
i dont think i would go again,0
we were a group of 8 and well seved,2
and thats no mean feat,1
i often go there to eat with my family,1
i wish they would change back to what it was before,1
the signs the specials menus food and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese,1
no pizza 33 for me,1
i love their spicy scallop roll and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken,2
im no food critic but id like to think i have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in ny for the last 11 years,1
i noted it was crossed off on the bill,1
needless to say im never going back and you should be wary too,1
best dish is noriwrapped tuna,2
the food was absolutely amazing,2
some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food,1
an excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but the food was slightly disappointing,0
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood,2
i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time,1
i went here with my boyfriend and another couple,1
the staff is also attentive and friendly,2
the all you can eat deal is truly amazing here,2
that is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste,0
this is definitely a place that provides the best experience though to both alisters and people walking in off the street,2
they were such a ripoff 895 for four small meat patties in steamed buns and not worth trying,0
first it took us a long time to find the place,0
all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better,2
it is about food and ambiance and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine,0
the food was good too,2
we have tried every thai restaurant between atlantic avenue and 4th streets and joya is the best,2
immediately after we paid the waiter took the money and said okay you guys are outta here,1
the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over how refreshing,2
admittedly this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate and thank goodness in my opinion but for simple elegant sushi there is no better place in new york or anywhere in the us,2
i am a die hard peep lover,2
once you become a regular you are treated as one,1
the menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them,2
everyone treats you like you were part of the family,1
the white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal,2
the rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats,2
the menu is nothing like the one on the website,0
great food great lay out and awesome service,2
ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away,1
sea has become so popular that theyve let it go to their heads,1
we walked in on a wednesday night and were seated promptly,1
chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city,2
the wait staff is very freindly they make it feel like youre eating in a freindly little european town,2
oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant arties cafe,1
besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city,1
my roommate and i love this place,2
the waitstaff are all very busy its not outstanding service but ive never been dealt with rudely,0
i have lived in japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan,1
not worth it,0
in the evening this place attracted a well dressed with it ny crowd,2
they have it all great price food and service,2
so close but not good enough,0
this was on a tuesday night,1
its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car i happen to live in inwood,0
the flavors are great and the menu is extensive,2
the food was amazing the service was so attentive and personable and how about that ambience,2
this place has the best interior i have seen anywhere in the northside of wburg and will impress whoever you bring there,2
the food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down,2
i found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying fresh and yummy,2
and forget what you read under me the atmosphere isnt that bad either,2
dont waste your time or money,0
they dont concern much of customers health just want to make money,0
we couldnt carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that were taking too much time amazing we just sat down,0
sometimes i get good food and ok service,2
we just ate at kai and were disapointed,0
its a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks,0
this was a great surprise,2
after complaining about the chicken dish the manager came over to tell us that no one had ever complained before and that we just didnt know what the dish was supposed to taste like,0
the food was spicy and delicious,2
i went with my fiance on a tuesday evening,1
a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite,1
it was wonderful,2
went for a late weekday lunch,1
i just dont understand all the hype,0
bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar,0
anyways if youre in the neighborhood to eat good food i wouldnt waste my time trying to find something rather go across the street to tamari,1
dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet,1
although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier at the same time it doesnt really matter,1
you can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation,0
this was my frist time at cafe st barts and i must say how delicous the food and the service was,2
i dont get it either,0
went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers,1
great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work,2
its like they took leftover chicken poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it the sauce was translucent and red,1
one would think wed get an apology or complimentary drinks instead we got a snobby waiter wouldnt even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so,0
one of my favorite places in manhattan,2
they brought glasses and the bottle and just left the bottle at our table,1
we actually gave 10 tip which we have never done despite mediocre food and service because we felt totally ripped off,0
we were looking forward to nice glass of sangria when we arrived,2
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window,2
while we enjoyed the food we were highly disappointed by the poor service waiter was not quite competent and slow service and lack of remorse,0
i for one will never patronize them again,0
i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood,2
after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant and passing by it on a daily basis we decided to try,2
the service however was a bright flower in a garden,2
so again give it a try,1
stay far away from this place,0
we will come back,2
weve been to grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed,0
the food is very good too but for the most part its just regular food nothing special,2
a touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed,2
tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since its one of my favorite dishes,2
wed go back again,1
we ate out in the back patio which is worth it as its cool and the music is hear well there,2
the location is perfect,2
guacamoleshrimp appetizer was really great we both had the filet very good didnt much like the frites that came with but the filet was so good neither of us cared,2
the lunch special is an asbolute steal,0
this food is asianair fusion,1
nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price,2
the chicken pot pie is excpetiona the cheeseburger huge and delictable and the service professional wan warm,2
while i quite liked the food and the ambience im not quite sure if it they really deserve it the michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window,1
im surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here ive been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning,2
but on a lazy saturday night we ended up going,1
there are a few italian employees who may not speak the best english but for me that adds to the experience,1
i have never eaten in the restaurant however upon reading the reviews i got take out last week,0
once for dinner and once for brunch,1
ive been to at cafe spice probably 58 times it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square,2
not worth the prices,0
would recommend perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central,2
from the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just fantastic,2
service was good and food is wonderful,2
i only have friends,1
she gets 10 for her excellent service and advice,2
the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal,1
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods indian included i made friends with this place long ago,2
please save yourself the frustration,0
and i say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner,0
the quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10,2
i have eaten at saul many times the food is always consistently outrageously good,2
always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer,1
if your visiting youll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that its in time sq,2
we were on our way back to nj and since i am in ny we figured why not grab some food,1
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective,2
and comparing it to the chinatown restaurants is simply not fair,0
service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money,1
love the atmosphere felt like i was in paris,2
every course was better than the next,2
not cheap but not that expensive either,1
the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive,2
if presentation and service is your thing then this magic show works,2
apparently the good cook works then,2
i was pleasantly suprised,2
the yellowtail was particularly good as well,2
one less manhattanite the better,1
everyone is welcomed in as family,2
i ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil,2
the menu changed portions were even smaller than before a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility a basmati rice dish lacked flavor,0
spice is sleek modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet,2
patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff,2
hey i think 2 for a 5 block walk aint bad,2
very affordable and excellent ambient,2
look elsewhere,1
more important the sushi rivals the best in tokyo,1
i have never had cheescake like this,0
bill a little high but worth it,2
i seriously doubt i will ever dine at jimmys bronx or for that matter jimmys uptown again,0
everyone i bring here always loves it,2
my coworkers had to wait almost an hour for delivery only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered,0
worth a visit,2
a real dissapointment,0
its a goto for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests,2
why do people rave about the ambience,0
were meeting up with some friends for a drink at lafayette 161 and happened to walk by thai angel famished,1
fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapenolime olive oil the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fishs sweetness,2
great sushi experience,2
if youre looking for a great meal at a decent price go to del friscos,2
they charge 600 for rice,0
my steak au poivre was one of the worst ive had,0
on a recent sunday afternoon a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt,2
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance,2
try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh a delicious and sweet tasting bread,2
although the tables may be closely situated the candlelight foodquality and service overcompensate,0
the food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive considering we were the only ones there for the first hour,2
from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it,2
i will be going back and heartily recommend it,2
would definitely visit again,2
definitely worth the trip to battery park city,2
perhaps this food is considered extreme to an upper east side resident but for the rest of us whove actually eaten ethnic food this is simply dull,0
the place was real empty but that was because this was the first sunday they ever opened,1
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money,2
ambience is delightful service impeccable,2
service was excellent and the ac worked very well too thank god it was hot,2
tasty but expensive,0
you get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice,2
both are delicious the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand,2
so i thought why not change it up a bit,1
my friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great,2
although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different,1
the staff was accomodating the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely,2
ps please dont tell anyone in my family i eat there,1
my picks are scallion pancake fried with vegetable juice very special and tasty guizhou chicken shredded squid family style one of my personal favorites sichuan spicy soft shell crab shuizhu fish this one is for hardcore sichuan food fans i wouldnt recommend to my american friends as its very spicy,2
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone,0
to celebrate a birthday three of us went to mare anticipating great food,2
there was a great deal for 6 blue point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for 8,2
i really liked the noodle dishes at rice avenue compared to their green curry dish,2
i went to pams with my girlfriend and i love it,2
but for whatever reason prices are about twice as high,0
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overated and on the pricey side,0
great atmoshere and worth every bit,2
we had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant,0
the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome great appetizer to share,2
the staff was knowledgeable and full of personality,2
great staff,2
only complaint would be that at an average cost of 1215 per meal id like not to have to worry about finding a seat,0
to finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert especially the white chocolate bread pudding with gelato and hot chocolate,2
the banana tower is an amazing dessert as well,2
i went there with my friend last saturday,1
excellent atmosphere delicious dishes good and friendly service,2
a cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts,2
great vibe lots of people,2
i like mamouns food as well but side by side kati rolls just produce tastier food hands down,2
just an odd group,1
the service is a bit slow but harkens back to my years growing up in napoli italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night,1
either that or the editors idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th,1
i love this place,2
it is not consistent,0
but that wasnt the icing on the cake a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had,0
great food and the prices are very reasonable,2
wine list is not huge but def well selected,2
a cool bar with great food and tons of excellent beer,2
be sure to try the seasonal and always delicious specials,2
the ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service,2
fresh authentic french cuisine in substantial portions,1
drinks got screwed up she acted put upon,0
the one vegetarian entree abbys treasure was actually quite a surprise it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables,2
at 5 dumplings for 1 you just cannot go wrong,1
but the pizza is way to expensive,0
and the staff is also young energeic and hot,2
even better they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it,2
service was decent but not as smooth as i would expect from a place with these prices and reputation,0
we had a wonderful meal at naples 45 a month ago on a visit to nyc,2
good drink,2
great food spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom,2
was there friday night,1
we had a girls night dinner here for restaurant week,1
romantic if you want it to be brightly lit,1
however i was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from london noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling,1
i recommend it,2
i have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in ny and hooked a few new yorkers onto peep as well,1
enough said,1
i dont live in ny but my best friend does,2
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily,0
even though i made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through dinnerbroker we were seated at a table with one of the best view,2
we did notice however that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan,1
i didnt take a look at the rest menu but the oysters were fantastic,2
after the review i treked into brooklyn,1
the grilled cheese at home afterwards was better,2
we were pleasantly greeted,2
the red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside,1
great service great food,2
the food is expensive but worth every bite,2
sometimes i get bad food and bad service sometimes i get good good and bad service,0
when we were finally seated our waitress came by twice1 for our order and 2for our check,1
in summereat outside on a terrace another great feature of suan,2
its the perfect restaurant for ny life style it got cool design awsome drinks and food and lots of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar,2
recommendations of course are required,1
we did have to wait at the bar for approx,1
you fellas above says its the best taiwanese restaurant in town,2
yeah its that good,2
if you love seafood you would love this place,2
good fast service,2
dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty indian restaurant in the upper east side,2
they charge different prices all the time,0
to dine at thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside its so bland on the inside,0
i was in love with pongsri on 48th but compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced,0
my friends and i experienced amazing cheese and a delicious new summer menu at artisanal last night,2
i am so coming back here again as much as i can,2
i have been going back again and again,1
its charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic even,2
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine,0
in terms of the food itself nothing special we limited ourselves to several appetizers,1
love the jazz bands on fri and sat,2
overall excellent restaurant,2
to begin we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready,1
the servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait shortly i might add,1
the service was ok,2
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants he replied this is not mcdonalds every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude,1
i ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it,2
dont expect to sit down inside though there are only a few tables and they are always full,1
the staff is accomodating the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed and the food is out of this world,2
the food was delicious i had a halibut special my husband had steak and the service was topnotch,2
the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group,0
this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood,2
but too far east,1
satisfying,2
highly highly highly recommended,2
its the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food,2
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it,2
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation,1
this place is cool enough to be in the east village but french enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in paris,2
we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry,2
the staff are attentive and have smiles on their faces,2
this is the best shabushabu restaurant in the trystate area,2
no dress codes no attitudes plenty of comfort companionship a great place to relax in an always busy midtown,2
largest and freshest pieces of sushi and delicious,2
even the pasta is delicious here a rarity in new york pizza restaurants,2
but when we looked at the menu there werent a lot of choices most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section,1
maybe i say so because it looked promising for people who like arteryclogging jewish deli food but turns out to be poorly run and awful,0
after my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer,2
this place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the prospect expressway and greenwood cemetery a wasteland we like to call the sliv,2
now if they could only get a toaster,1
you will find yourself returning quite often,1
when hes not making authentic neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms hes visiting the regulars a growing legion and checking on newcomers,1
wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws,2
the ingredients taste fresher the crust is thinner and crispier the slice is less oily and its never burnt like it occasionally is at joes,2
fish is so very fresh,2
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food,1
go only if you are already in the neighborhood and dont want to bother going farther for a better place,1
top spot in town for vietnamese classics better than places that cost a lot more,2
less wait time for me,1
this was the perfect quiet relaxing and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater,2
the decor is really blah and not at all hip or happening,0
having discovered pings on the internet we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in,2
you cannot go wrong at the red eye grill,2
it appears to be the owners first venture and it shows,1
i come from a family of pizzeria owners and im almost ashamed to say that the pizza in forninos blows my families receipies away,0
i go twice a month,1
we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai,0
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great,2
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great,2
the food was authentic,2
the dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet,2
i only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce but it actually faired better than most nyc italian joints ive tried similar dishes at,2
the worst excuse for japanese food ive ever encountered,0
a million better places to go in the city,2
if celebrities make you sweat then your in for a ride but if your like most around these parts then youll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype,0
okayi dont mind the oily part cause most are cooked that way but it was way too bland,0
i ordered a chicken teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry,0
i love it,2
if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde,1
we had reservations at 9pm but was not seated until 1015pm,1
we had pams special fried fish and it was amazing,2
its located in greenewich village,1
there is no excuse for such lousy service,0
three strikes and this restaurant is out,0
we bring in a party of ten or so every week,1
my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque,2
so a little inconsistency there but either way both pizzas were really good,2
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites but everything was delicious,2
we would return to this place again,1
not enough wines by the glass either,0
i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible,2
i must say its a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view,0
these innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible,2
just dont take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there,0
no gimmicks here the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation,2
we were worried we would have trouble getting in but somehow managed to have a short wait,1
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it,2
everything i had was good and im a eater,2
one should not go to lucky strike for the food,0
the service is awfulthe last time i was there and i do mean the last time we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave,0
we could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue,1
to me it exemplifies soho cute artsy interesting,2
try everything for that matter it is all good,2
both times we waited well over a half hour for a table even though we had reservations,1
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone,2
ive been eating at taj mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the indian eateries on this block of indian restaurants,2
night without a reservation we had to wait at the bar for a little while but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience,2
try the green curry,1
we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful,2
we were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional,2
you rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys masaman green red are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it,2
the food there are sastifying,0
i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try,2
i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks,2
the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines,2
i agree,2
last memorial day i tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend interesting but,1
the food was good,2
great wine selection gigondas is worth the price and the house champagne is a great value,2
at night but its hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury the music playing in the background is also voluminous,1
it just wasnt thai,1
i have enjoyed everything i have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way,2
i particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection,2
i love to visit murrays for my bagel fix,2
we made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed reminds me of my grandfather its old school italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire,2
recommended,1
the place was nice and calm,2
cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at 10,2
i could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched so watch out,0
when we sat we got great and fast service,2
most of the servers are very attentive friendly and quite attractive,2
i think locals rate this place so high,2
service is average,0
but theyve done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the godmother pizza a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oilbrushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual,2
go girls,1
they forgot a sandwich didnt include plastic forks and didnt include pita with the hummus platter,0
the steak is good the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great,2
for asian fusion there are many places further downtown,1
old school meets new world,1
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded,0
the service was poor restaurant poorly lit staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonalds than this joint,0
this is probably one of my new favorite places,2
for being number 1 this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation,1
for myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion i do prefer smaller quiter restaurants,1
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side,2
they all know you,1
my gf and i still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails the chill decor and the decent sushi,2
we ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin,2
the buffet had a nice selection,2
waitstaff are very friendly,2
this restaurant is such a great place,2
once you step into cosette youre miraculously in a small offthebeaten path parisian bistro,2
ive been several times and am totally smitten,2
terrible experience,0
i love the place,2
service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded,0
will have to return to try the chocolate,1
its only 195 for a regular slice and 400 for a slice with a mushroom not mushrooms,1
there is a real gallery of stars that have visited,2
the food was below average the service was pathetic there was no ambience at all,0
i really enjoyed the shows put on by the actors,2
our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel,1
service was efficient courteous,2
this one is definintely my least favorite,0
i have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn,2
the miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past,0
everytime my husband and i go there we are never disappointed,2
they are the best bagels ive had,2
we were not disappointed,1
ive read some of the previews reviews people are either not new yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food,0
toons has recently been redone so its now a very attractive space,2
160 for 2 filets 2 sides an appetizer and drinks,1
while the prices are nothing special the portions are huge,1
its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal relax be able to talk and have a very good time,2
we arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past but thats just it the past,1
however i think this place is a good hang out spot,2
the menu is prix fixe so be prepared to spend at least 60 per person but it is well worth itsuperb food,2
rao is a good restaurant but its nothing special,0
the wine list is extensive and impressive,2
we had the most wonderful waitress,2
while the staff at this little bistro is very friendly i have never experienced more incompetency,0
the quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor,2
when we left at 800 pm it was packed and noisy,1
okay so i never write but there doesnt seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning green bo and its time to speak up i live in chinatown,0
the zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth,1
the staff is courteous and friendly,2
never fails to please,2
decor is nice though service can be spotty,2
aside from the rushed service we were very impressed with the food and the drinks,2
will absolutely visit again,2
make sure you have the spicy scallop roll,1
i would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar,2
and even with its pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too,2
this big draw is the all you can sushi here for 1995,2
i consider the best grand sichuan restaurant in nyc,2
we spent 50 definetly will come back with my friends,2
went to village last night for my birthday,1
some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers other times theyve skipped my order,0
the specials are usually quite good too,2
theyve the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods,2
try the chocolate mud cake warmed with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato,1
thats good and bad,1
really cool stauff inside,2
while the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made tiffin so attractive the menu has been overhauled,1
the best burger i have had in the village,2
we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their 35 menu,1
i would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space,1
came here for restaurant week didnt save much but it was still great,2
would never go back there,0
three of us arrived for dinner about 530 on a week night without reservations,1
the blond wood decor is very soothing the premium sake is excellent and the service is great,2
there is usually a wait but it is well worth it,2
be careful when they say spicy they mean it,1
your money could easily be better spent elsewhere anywhere,0
only drawback they wont toast your bagel and they dont make eggs for the bagel,0
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited,2
bring your appetites,1
the wait staff is pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeous in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way not in that sheswaycuterthanmethatb way,2
of course this atmosphere is lacking but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways,0
service was very good and warm,2
for dinner i had the chicken tikkamasala and some garlic naan,1
cornelia street looks like a broadway set for west side story and the inside of po is so cool quaint you really cant top the setting for a romantic dinner in nyc,2
like others have said dont expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes a busy restaurant may require you to wait,1
seriously this place kicks ass,2
food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went,2
also because it is so thin it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling,0
the food is nothing like its menu description,0
try the pad seew or chicken with cashew nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience,2
its just ok pizza,1
i loved it and would highly recommend,2
ive been here twice now,1
the food is decent at best and the ambience well its a matter of opinion some may consider it to be a sweet thing i thought it was just annoying,0
the best place to bring kids or any friends who want to do something different,2
the service was a bit slow but they were very friendly,2
however i do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant,0
its a small cute restaurant,2
i will be returning,1
leon is an east village gem casual but hip with well prepared basic french bistro fare good specials a warm and lively atmosphere,2
the food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other heartland breweries in the city,2
thius is a must for anyone who loves shabushabu,2
the food was absolutely horrible,0
food doesnt appear to be cooked on premisis but theres a high turnover so its pretty fresh,2
restaurant was dirty and unkempt,0
nice place though,2
warning you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu,1
similar to other indian restaurants they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door,1
it is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet go late and it will be packed,2
the people with carts of food dont understand you because they dont speak english their job is to give you the delicious food you point at,0
the crackling calamari salad which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants is crispy and lightly dressed,0
not the greatest sushi place but excellent for a 1995 all you can eat,2
shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here simple contract deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20,1
the thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy,2
weve never had any problems with the staff but maybe weve been lucky,2
drinks way over priced,0
the main downside to the place is the nazilike guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level,0
what i didnt like was how the food came right after it was ordered,0
but warning to all those that use this site be weary be very weary of recommendations,0
moderate prices,1
we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night,2
try it side by side and theres no comparison,1
i think ive had some the best meals of my life at minnow,2
my biggest complaint was the untasty food although presented well,0
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets with that certain parisian flair,2
so sorry i cant rate this better,0
most importantly food is excellent,2
buon appetito,1
great roofdeck nice group of 30 somethings but no music kind of quiet,2
if we were to move from the upper east side we would genuinely miss this restaurant,0
the best part of the experience was knowing that the manager a bubbly friendly young woman with a great smile truly cared about how we were doing,2
ok for all of us growing up in the village of nyc we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants most of which stay open very late,0
however service was as plain as sesame crusted salmon i had,1
i would highly recommend it,2
its great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend,2
the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back,0
lloovve this place,2
so some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise,1
you get what you pay for and with that logic in mind spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting,2
finally after all the raving i went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be,2
place should also have a 123 chili rating to be more authentic,1
the service was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served,0
went last thursday,1
i love this place more and more everytime i go,2
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try,2
other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced the atmosphere is filled with energy and the beautiful people of course and the food was surprising good,2
we only ordered desserts and drinks but no refills were offered,1
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn,2
waiters are slow but sweet,2
i have been here a few times for dinner once for brunch and twice for lunch,1
we went to ino for valentines,1
the real kicker of the menu however is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass,1
it was good but was not what i thought it would be,1
the music is the best among all the indian restaurants i have visited,2
the bread and lamb chops i had before the meal were quite good however,2
he always says i dont have customers,0
raos has the best service and atmosphere in nyc,2
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian,1
good for dates or with friends,2
they never brought us complimentary noodles ignored repeated requests for sugar and threw our dishes on the table,0
one of the best chicken tikka masala,2
excellent dumplings served amid clean chic decor,2
the kitchen however is almost always slow,0
the corned beef and pastrami are excellent much less fatty than those big tourist places around times square,2
cute place nice wait staff but would never go there again,2
we had a good time,2
also the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday unexpected but a truly above and beyond thing to do,2
people are rude bit again its new york,0
we all felt it was worth it,2
the plain slice is great and if you get toppings the whole slice is topped with them not sparsely sprinkled on like some places,2
service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great,0
service is great takeout is good too,2
based on the reviews on here it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 pm,1
the pizza is overpriced and soggy,0
everything is excellent the menu is quite extensive and you eat with a view on both sides of the city,2
youll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city and most still dont compare,0
for the quality of food a little too expensive,0
came looking for this place because i heard good things,2
i live on the street this place is on,0
horrible,0
heres to the fake fish tanks too,0
its worth the wait though,1
ive never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious,2
the first time i went and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere i ordered the lobster cobb salad,1
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute,2
what an amazing meal and experience,2
unique apppetizers,1
the staff has always been attentive and kind and ive always been amazed at how theyve handled all the various different group sizes that come in,2
it is the best deal in town for a monday night dinner at a fine restaurant,2
nothing special about this place,0
also the sandwiches nearing 7 didnt come with anything like chips or a side,1
and never strayed,1
the wait here is long for dim sum but if you dont like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig this is a sleek for chinatown alternative,0
leave the kids at home,1
this place has good potential but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else,1
everything is always cooked to perfection the service is excellent the decor cool and understated,2
and all of that wont break your bank,1
the thai food is good,2
just moved to the neighborhood and weve been trying all the west village sushi restaurants,1
great selection of wine and seafood,2
delicious,2
acceptable prices,1
big thumbs up,2
we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda,1
we have lived in chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant,1
as i made the title its an affordable restaurant for great taste,2
they even scoop it out nice for those on a diet not too much not to little,2
definitely not worth the price,0
orsay is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional french food and french service as well,1
its easy to get a table for a large group and you dont get hustled out,2
great food at reasonable prices,2
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal,2
i ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked thai flavors in unexpected ways,2
thats why you have to pay more for that,0
if youve ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer,1
i loved it,2
theyre are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing queens,2
the prices are about 9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch,1
and you cant beat the prices,0
but i wouldnt wanna live there,0
arigato gozimas yuka,1
should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it,2
i had the black cod with yuzu sauce which was wonderful,2
prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant,0
tuk tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in brooklyn,2
this quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip,2
i knew upon visiting nyc that i wanted to try an orginal deli,1
i would highly recommend this place,2
total hipsterwannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot,1
yes there might be a wait if you have no reservations,1
thank you emilio,2
first of all dal bukhara rocks,1
everything from the soft bread soggy salad and 50 minute wait time with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food,0
i asked for them spicy and they were delicious,2
it is terrific as is the value,2
the sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great,2
downstairs lounge is always a good attraction,2
the menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size,0
the food was amazing and the service was prompt and helpful but not overbearing or rushed,2
food was delivered by a busboy not waiter we got no cheese offered for the pasta our water and wine glasses remained empty our entire meal when we would have easily spent another 20 on wine,1
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well,2
the food was not fresh the sauces were bland and very oily,0
off the beaten path this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street indian restaurants,2
could be pricey without a prix fixe meal,0
this is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive,2
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices,2
one of us actually liked the expresso thats it,2
everyone was more then happy with his choices,2
again the waitress was awesome,2
worth the trip from manhattan,1
i loved everythig about itespecially the shows and actors,2
the service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals,2
the food was just ok i would never go back,2
zero ambiance to boot,1
got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full,1
scalina fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining,2
i recommend the thai popcorn,2
i cant wait for the nex time,2
everything looks great the drinks the decor the food even the people,2
as soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out,1
the parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed,2
great neighborhood joint,2
the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent,2
the only disappointment was the coat check girls who didnt seem to know what a customer is on a realtively nonbusy night for the coat check girls,0
my fiance took me to scopa last week for my birthday and i couldnt believe the food,2
ummmthe beer was cold,0
i take all my nyc guests to vts,1
it is sometimes a little cramped and can get a little warm but hello its nyc,1
we had great desserts including the best cannoli ive ever had and then they offered an after dinner drink on the house,2
good crowd good outdoor seating with a hip japanese vibe,2
even with the prix fixe pricing this restaurant is not worth it,0
we asked to be moved which took half an hour and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back even though the rest of the room was practically empty,1
good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off like in this case,2
however their popularity has yet to slow down and i still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation,2
where tanks in other chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sadlooking marine life in their murky waters the tanks at pings are clear as glass with healthylooking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lovers brunch,0
the halibut was too salty dessert was so so dont waste any of your calories and service was poor,0
the view is spectacular and the food is great,2
the place wasnt too hard to find but it was kind of packed as soon as my boyfriend and i got our food the line reached the door,1
good bagels and good cream cheese,2
the food is wonderful tasty and filling and the service is professional and friendly,2
it is also extremely well priced,2
always great service,2
i am happy i did the food was awsome,2
i have been in many restaurants all over the city and roths steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites,2
we ordered the chicken casserole but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken all dark meat and on the bone,1
a bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks,1
i went to df for valentines day dinner,1
i recommend the jelly fish drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings certainly the stir fry blue crab,2
i loved the shows,2
and i have been around the block to say the very least,1
we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu,2
the aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge,1
then get ripped on free box wine,1
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food,1
if you dont mind presliced low quality fish unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place,0
the food itself was just ok nothing spectacular but the service was awful,0
the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere,2
as there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats except at taj mahal,1
also dont plan on asking for your favorite roll if its not on the menu you cant have it,0
give it a try and enjoy,2
and thats saying a lot,1
those rolls were big but not good and sashimi wasnt fresh,0
the pesto pizza was excellent thincrust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that id never heard of before,2
the only thing i could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table,0
if your into thaiyou cannot miss this great restaurant,2
going to ballatos is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen an absolute delight,2
try the spicy shrimp appetizer again not the greatest value in the world but worth the price and the lamb vindaloo is great,2
however go for the ambience and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world,1
i think this is one of the more underrated places in the city,1
for outoftowners who will get a big thrill out of the location,2
everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends,1
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit,0
i go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed,2
obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong it actually means great prosperity,2
i think the restaurant was too loud when full to be romantic,0
i have had so many dinners here and its always been perfect on a date with my husband with my mom with girlfriends and larger groups,2
when you want a piece of beef head on over,1
delicate spices onions eggs and a kickass roti,2
incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic thai restaurant,2
i actually gave patroon another chance before writing this but the second visit was even worse,0
also if you dont want to sit at a certain table you dont have to,0
unbelievable,0
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning,2
ive been living in the columbia university area for about 10 years with 3 kids now in their teens,1
the menu has lots of options i hope to go back to try those potato pancakes,2
as soon as i wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how i will be getting to fried dumpling,1
the staff isnt the friendliest or most competent and i am stickler for service but everything else about this place makes up for it,0
my wife and i will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them as they tend to offer large portions,1
this restaurant was way overhyped,0
ive overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and ive been sitting there while he lectured another customer,0
delicious crab cakes too,2
now at the top of our list del friscos steakhouse,2
i cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there,0
this was the worst dining experience ive ever had,0
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna,2
just bring someone who speaks cantonese because waiter may not understand you,0
i thought i had died and gone to heaven,0
not someplace i would seek to try out but if i am in the area again i will certainly stop by,2
the bruschetta and paninis are so yummy,2
food was okay nothing great,1
every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair,1
i have been going there since it opened and i cant get enough,2
always popular always full always a wait,2
in fact you cant miss it,2
i recently tried suan and i thought that it was great,2
a little noise but i think that was because of our party,1
it is run by the same sichuan chef who started the chain in chinatown,1
get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago,1
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety serving almost 40 of items bbqed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with notsofresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance,1
i cant wait for summer when they serve outside on their gigantic patio,2
best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous,2
if you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share kai may not be the best option,1
go here for the drinks,1
i dont get it whats so special about prune,0
id definitely recommend this little place,2
again if you are in this neighborhood by all means come here,1
the first 2 courses were very good but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet,2
butter was melted white wine warm cheese oozing everywhere,1
we had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning,2
do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joes to eat here,1
it cannot be the ambience because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle,0
i have eaten at shabu tatsu at least 5 times and i always want to go back for more,2
we were disappointed with the prefixe menu of only 2 choices per course other restaurants offer 3 choices and ended up ordering a la carte,0
authentic pakistani food,1
the staff has always been friendly without seeming grating and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions,2
get it together,1
the eggplant parmesan is also great and my friend who grew up in manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce,2
quality ingredients preparation all around and a very fair price for nyc,2
service was very good prompt attentive and nonintrusive,2
my entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid and was unnecessarily heated with a burner,0
we began with the cheese fondue the artisanal blend and added apples and kielbasa to dip,1
in such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch this place is great,2
its not curry in a slurry crap and regular run of the mill food,0
in fact while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu and i couldnt help telling them that the food was horrible,0
even though the restaurant was packed we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems,2
if you want americanized chinese food with your usual watery generic white sauce this is your place,1
the bread is the soft paratha bread unlike the plain bread they use in calcutta and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful,1
service is friendly prices are good delivery time was a little slow but for the way this pizza tastes im willing to overlook it,2
the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you dont like,2
the service is excellent the decor is great and the food is delicious and comes in large portions,2
a word to the wise the hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is the cleanest restaurant in town,2
an excellent service,2
the food however is what one might expect,1
i love their thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must,2
i must give it yon out of yon stars,1
the pizza was really good,2
the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting the additional menu items are only written in chinese,0
food is average and i would say even the chain restaurant baluchis tastes better,0
the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic,2
the food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate,2
a little crowded but they move that line really fast,1
enjoy,2
kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them,2
kudos to po,2
the entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner,2
my boyfriend and i were in ny for a few days and pastis was a place that came recommended,2
the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice,2
the food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible,2
the bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that i will never go back,0
their sushi kamikaze and other rolls are fresh and well presented,2
for authentic thai food look no further than toons,1
its true you feel like your in a scene from goodfellas,1
i read the other review and have to say i had the opposite experience here last sunday,0
the highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries i received from one of the food runners which is not good considering the bill was nearly 100,0
i choose to go with one of the special the braised lamb shank in red wine which was excellent,2
if anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about winesplease check their wine list,1
never again,0
the only concern i have is with the slighly allbusiness waitstaff who order and throw the food down rushing you out,0
have the iced tea,1
for park avenue i expected so much more,1
small servings for main entree i had salmon wasnt impressed girlfriend had chicken it was good,2
so rude,0
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce,2
the ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date,2
they are fast,1
it is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere,2
the food is very good for its price better than most fried dumplings ive had,2
there are much better places in ny with better prices,2
very neighborhoody very quick and sufficient,2
obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys,2
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive,0
everything is delicious though my gf and i come here once a week sometimes you will get addicted,2
and i could do without the cigar smoke,1
still try it once since if you end up loving the food it could be one of your best dining experiences,2
ive waited over one hour for food,0
other guests enjoyed pizza santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips,2
the ambience is very calm and quiet,2
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service which was boarderline rude,0
stay away from the latter since you wont go for seconds hint hint,1
not only does make the best pizza in ny maybe anywhere,2
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that ive had at this price range,2
price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit,0
our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine,2
the place is a bistro which means simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere,2
this is one of the best comfort food places in the city,2
overall the ingredients and technique are there and i am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves,2
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll,2
though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room no matter what the size of your party the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters youll have fun and forgot about the tight spot youre in,2
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale,0
considering their price of 625 for lunch special the dish was ridiculously small,0
this is the pinnacle of indian fast food all fast foods in my opinion,2
besides when you have bad service thats less money you have to tip,0
we do not need to go to a fourstar restaurant anymore,0
the wine list is also really nice,2
i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others,2
i plan on stopping by next week as well,1
service was devine oysters where a sensual as they come and the price cant be beat,1
compared to essa tal offers a less doughy bagel,1
ballatos is consistently delicious authentic italian food,2
the service was attentive yet discreet,2
as a retired hipster i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laidback late night in the city,2
for those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more,1
then if they answer the phone youre lucky if they dont hang up on you,1
they offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names but they do cost you,1
we went to eat at the jekyll and hyde restaurant on friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food,2
the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions,2
highly recommended to all,2
highly recommended,2
unless you are eating in the pizzeria side of this place and are not in a rush this place is a bad idea,0
you have to increase the service a lot,1
ambiance is barely romantic but management tries,1
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small especially the appetizers so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chefs special tasting menu prepare to order and pay for an appetizer 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing a main entree and the cold udon at the end of the meal,1
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice,0
after we got our sashimi order i could not believe how small the portions were,0
after the main course came we didnt see our waiter for at least 40 minutes,1
it will be on my to do list the next visit to nyc,2
nothing better than buying a snapple for 325 too,2
when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets and then ordered for them,1
i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken,2
service is extraordinary yet not overbearing and the decor brings a taste of trendy soho into queens,2
the dosas are skimpy unattractive and drip with grease and personally id drink popcorn topping before id eat another one of these,0
the service was excellent and the food was delicious,2
if i wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers id go out in manhattan,0
after a seafood craving i checked citysearch and chose to go to fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info,1
right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city,1
until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating,0
always fresh and delicious,2
the food was very good but not very thai,2
thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you but the food doesnt quite match up,0
the fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty,2
this is the perfect spot for meeting friends having lunch dinner pretheatre or aftertheatre drinks,2
this is a fun restaurant to go to,2
the mussaman curry that i ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that i ordered in it they graciously provided me with one piece of poorly cooked potato,0
had a late night dinner on a saturday night,1
a restaurant that doesnt try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere,2
their sake martini is wonderful,2
well this place is so ghetto its not even funny,0
bravissimo,1
once they ran out of gnochi and made it for me from scratch,1
we would like to thank marcelo and grace for a wonderful dining experience,2
found service above average but that could be because we were 13 of us,1
when i arrived at orsay i was thrown back in a veyr good sense,1
bagels are ok but be sure not to make any special requests,1
this is the cheers of new york whether youve ever been there or not,2
its to die for,0
cute and decorative,2
i know this is the case in many nyc eateries but here they really cram you in to the point where its borderline uncomfortable,0
fine dining restaurant quality,1
overall a disappointing experience for that price category,0
ive had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times when i have been in the neighborhood,1
the food was exceptional,2
you will be satisfied,2
another great place to take outoftowners,2
but hey there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in astoria,2
we were less than impressed,0
a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner,1
but still my date was bad,0
would definitely go back again,2
i have been to raos probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better,2
the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that,2
and i have eaten my share which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve,2
sure the setting is nice,2
overall a worthwhile experience,2
the service is friendly if not the most prompt in the world the food is great and the prices while not cheap wont put your wallet out of commission,2
had 1 appetizer 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was 5500 not including tip,1
its really a takeaway place i wouldnt sit if i could take it home,0
the most fun restaurant i have ever been too,2
best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town,2
some of the finest latin women youll see in your life hang out at jimmys,2
slightly above average wines start at 70 with only one selection listed at 30,1
their whitefish salad is excellentall whitefish with a little mayo,2
and it all comes at a very reasonable price congee noodles and rice dishes are no more than 36 each,2
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end not one person takes responsibility for anything,0
i had a great experience,2
the chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry inedible chicken with terrible sauce,0
i recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal,2
the waitresses are nicealso you can just get counter service sit,2
the only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar,2
having been a long time essabagel fan i was surpised to find myself return time and time again to murrays,2
go for it,1
highly recommended,2
you can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience but for superb food at reasonable prices la villa cant be beat,2
wont or cant is not in the service directory,0
i cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant,0
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy,1
to speak of the park side words can not describe,1
the red curry is weak and tasteless the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy the rice is often overcooked and the seafood is pretty sketchy,0
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal,2
saul is pretty good but definitely not great,0
i would recommend roxys for that but not for their food,0
we always get a sampling of appetizers and share,1
overall i was impressed and will return its a great qpr quality to price ratio,2
it is nearly impossible to get a table so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner do not pass it up,1
their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic,2
the puke green walls leave a lot to be desired but the food is very good,2
the flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive nothing flashy,2
i like cafe noir dont get me wrong it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent,0
the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed,0
but 1 for each small piece,1
our son loves pizza and we have a certified neapolitan pizzaria in our home city seattle we liked this nearly as much and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant,2
big and soft as well as good lunch food,2
no food snobs allowed this place is for people who appreciate good food,2
i liked the food at this quasithai restaurant,2
by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant,2
suan is a great place that i often take my friends classmates too,2
not a great place for family or general dining,0
as for the bar this is another bad idea,0
their bagels are fine but they are a little overcooked and not really a special bagel experience,1
unlike hh up the block this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for,2
i thought going to jimmys would give me a real domincan exprience,1
the barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry,2
same owner as the guy who owns typhoon which is just down the street on st marks and 1st ave,1
what generous portions,1
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese gets a little messy,0
i was wrong,0
the wine the service was very good too,2
so the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious,2
the highly spiced chai tea was great too,2
no plans to return anytime soon,1
i have been there many times and food is good and consistent,2
seriously this is the best all you can eat in town as everyone says the spicy tuna hand rolls are the best have 4 of these and youve broken even,2
there is not a single place in chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here,1
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city the food was not what i had hoped for,2
i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river seine,2
i just do not understand what the fuss is all about,0
the meat dishes were only soso,1
his wife tanya the hostess completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious,2
we liked it so much that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york,2
the menu consisted of standard brassiere food better then places like balthazar etc,2
i have been a longtime fan of holy basil in the east village and while i do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality i have been hesitant to be disloyal,1
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere delightfully free of the bts,2
for an untrendy ripoff eat here,1
and youre hungry a few hours later,1
i cant wait to go back,2
i hate hate hate this place,0
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves,2
the staff there is very attentive and down to earth,2
you dont go to mizu for excellent service you go for the large amounts of food the amiable atmosphere and the holeinthewall feeling of the place,2
the service is always bad though dont expect much of anything from your server and i would not recommend bringing a date here either,0
monday nights are a bargain at the 28 prix fix this includes a three course meal plus three glasses of wine paired with each course,2
wonderful,2
it took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses,1
the service is descent even when this small place is packed,1
this is the best sushi in new york city hands down,2
go hungry and enjoy,2
i have eaten a lot of pizza here,2
this place is worth an onehour drive,2
great value for the quality ingredients,2
the thali was small thoroughly unremarkable and 1495,1
the sushi is also great,2
from the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that i cant remember because of the fabulous cakebread cabernet we were drinking the whole evening was amazing,2
truly the mark of an attentive waiter,1
the food here is rather good but only if you like to wait for it,2
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries,2
the staff is very kind and well trained theyre fast they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations,2
the makhani was ok the korma was bland,1
the food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring,2
all i can say is wow,2
though the service could be better possibly due to more than one very large group in the house it is very cordial and warm as is the general clientele,2
the decor in this place is very dinerish and the kind of place you expect in the east village not romantic just simple small and sparse,0
this is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together,2
the lox is always fresh too,2
sure enough exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly,1
service was very friendly,2
so all im trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant ive ever been to,2
food was ok fish was cooked well,2
we actually left hungry and went across the street to wo hop at 15 mott street for some good chinese food,2
the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world,2
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff because despite the current one this is a great place,0
the service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but i have never been treated rudely,0
the staff offers impeccable service,2
the catch is that you are charged extra for anything that you leave on your plate so dont be a greedy pig,0
we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun dessert recommended by the waiter,2
wont come back again for sure,1
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family,1
this place doesnt compare with mamouns in terms of price freshness value and consisent quality but thats just my opinion,0
the place is sleek modern and playfull and i will return again frequently,2
i have known about this secret for the last 13 years emiliothe godfather has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices,1
the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal,2
after being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties multiples of 2 and higher seated for 40 minutes the three of us were squished into a small 2person table,1
and the bill was outragous,0
the service was attentive yet unimposing the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced,2
kind attentive wait staff,1
bon appettite,1
salads were fantastic,2
the owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic,2
la rosa waltzes in and i think they are doing it the best,2
the food is yummy especially their cookedtoperfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries,2
the food is authentic italian delicious,2
a great addition to smith street finally a place thats not pretentious and filled with women wearing ugg boots,2
skip dessert,1
we spent 200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed,0
it is simply amazing,2
i complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted,2
it was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool,1
i liked this place the first time but doubt i will ever return,1
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing,2
a great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from costco and sell it right outside for only 250,2
its all about the food,1
fast service,2
skip this restaurant its a big disappointment,0
the staff is excellent specjal that girl behind the bar european chic,2
stick with the chicken beef and lamb dishes,1
the service was bad the food took to forever to come we sat on the upper level,0
we a menu that rearely changese xcept for one or two specials the quality and care they put in thier food in evident,1
always full with tourists especially because of its close proximity to rockefeller center,2
the decor is nice but more casual than fine dining,2
this restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced,2
bravo blue hill,1
conveniently located too being right on bedford ave,2
my friends and i came across this place while walking in the village,1
bottom line b for the food f for the service,1
the only thing the waiters dont do for you is wipe your chin when you leave,0
this place is to be avoided,0
stick to dimsum not super overpriced noodles,1
the service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view,2
my sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by highschool students who dont know what they are doing,0
we there were four of us arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude,0
at 630 we were the third party there,1
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere,2
i will definetly be going back,2
no really,1
the food is good but very expensive for the casualness of it,2
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices,0
ive been to naples 45 for dinner twice,1
the hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else,0
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place he painted the ballatos sign in the window,2
try sushimi cucumber roll,1
im saving up for my next visit,1
the food is delicious,2
their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under 30,2
this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time,2
amma is nothing special,0
yeah shanghai is also great but not quite as good they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out,1
believe us weve been eating sushi for over 15 yrs,1
worth it for a special occasion or any time,1
the atmosphere is much better than sripraphai more modern and sleek,2
i recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady,2
the food is outstanding and the service is quick friendly and very professional,2
the bagels always warm soft on the inside crispy on the outside and enormous in size,2
i had a late dinner at lucky stike a great name for a joint if ever i saw one,2
been there done that and new york its not that big a deal,1
definitely a once a year treat that i look forward to around the holidays,2
service is fast and friendly,2
from an english speaking staff,1
anyhow we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat which was nice,2
and they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world,2
a defitely must visit,2
my husband and i enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full,2
i went here with a friend on a whim we went someplace else first and couldnt get a table,1
we all ate pasta entrees which were great,2
my friends and i showed up on a sat,1
the steak was excellent and one of the best i have had i tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat,2
great experience overall,2
perfect for dates,2
the food was boring and expensive,0
the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation so a casual lunch here would probably be best,2
terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes,2
the service is ok but could be better,2
we love the food drinks and atmosphere,2
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever,0
ive ordered from the 2nd ave,1
nothing against a good sales call but the tactics at amma are just too obvious,0
went on a 3 day oyster binge with fish bringing up the closing and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended because it was so great,2
took my mom for mothers day and the maitre d was pretty rude,0
my husband and i have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar chef yoshi and ordered everything ala carte,1
the vibe is very relaxed and cozy service was great and the food was excellent,2
if the weather is nice try to snag an outside table,2
if you are looking for a good quality cheap eats this is the place,2
however for what we spent overall it just was not up to par,0
the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual,2
a friend from seattle and i went on a thursday night around 830,1
when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else,2
i recommend their pad see ew pork chops or tofu plates,1
never in my life did i think that i could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for 300 in nyc,1
this is the best secret place in midtown i heard that from the bartender after having brilliant food try steak with portobello mushrooms and drinks on the bar last tuesday,2
the service was excellent friendly and attentive,2
the main course had an average portion and was decent overall,2
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other,2
just remember the later you go the longer you may have to wait,1
waitstaff is great very attentive,2
i live in the neightborhood and am a regular,1
the dinner menu is diverse and topnotch as well,2
it is what modern cuisine is all about,1
in any event even though its a bit on the pricey side we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back,2
i definitely will go back,2
i dont like indian food too much and this was delicious however you want to factor that into the equation,2
at taj vegetarians can rejoiceall the dishes are manna from heaven,2
forget the rush and the wait and the noise which isnt actually that bad i mean please who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic,1
having hunted around for a quiet romantic yet not hideously expensive restaurant i stumbled across reviews for la lanterna and gave it a shot,2
ive never been disappointed,1
i wont go back unless someone else is footing the bill,1
we live in new jersey and whenever we go into new york city we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze they told me that if i call in the order theyd bring it out to the car so i wouldnt have to look for parking,1
from the street it looks very hidden and is actually an old warehouse,1
jimmys is hands down the hottest night spot in the bronx,2
and i would have to agree with the masses in terms of service delivery is their achilles heel,1
my boyfriend and i have been to the minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed,2
the 300 bill was a bit steep but the experience was great,2
i wouldnt mind going back some time but not before trying others nearby,1
nice ambiance nice little bar good bartender francois and good service,2
i found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons,2
the calamari comes with an incredible sauce and the duck noodles are yummy as well,2
i would definitely go back if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard,2
for some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening i dont understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area,2
simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions,1
but i just would like to say i read the reviews people left and thats why i checked it out,1
stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu though too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick,1
ive eaten at pizza gruppo a few times but more often i order delivery,1
we didnt get drink refills and she didnt even offer us the option of dessert,0
beautiful experience,2
the bagels are also reasonably priced for nyc,2
if you can handle that its a great place for a business dinner fun with friends or simply a table for 2,2
decor leaves something to be desired,0
jimmy is dominican,1
also specify if you like your food spicy its rather bland if you dont,1
our waiter was fine the place looks nice in that nottryingtoohard way but at those prices a little more should be expected of your food,2
coming from boston this place is like emmas pizza in kendall square in cambridge although they have more funky toppings,2
when my husband and go there we spend 6000 have lobster tails ummmmm need i say more i cant say any more it a place youll never forget if you never go youll miss a meal of your life time,2
in an effort to increase turnover the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse,1
ive been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when im craving for pho lemon grass chicken or beef cube on rice this is the place to go,2
oh yes and if you are a fan of indian oldies film stars there are plenty of portraits of indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls some of which i would love to know where they obtained,2
the food is spectacular from the appitizers to the main course and then of course the desserts wow youll need no more,2
the neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead,2
my fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce,2
if you are in search of the most authentic nyc deli experience look no further than the famous and historic katzs deli down on the lower east side,2
even upon delivery their juicy pork buns are quite good,2
this is also where i was from,1
everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table,1
average to good thai food but terrible delivery,0
the space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise,2
the entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt,1
joes pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up,2
i in all reality felt as if i had just gotten off air france and was in the 8th district in paris,1
i have never had anything like it,0
yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously but it shouldnt,0
and they provided a delicious dessert on the house,2
they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine so if you want to make a reservation you are limited,0
the food is amazing rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza,2
food was very good but not what i would consider out of this world,1
i had lobster bisque it has 2 oz of maine lobster in it,1
i am indian and i have tried many indian places in ny,1
try the pad thai its fabulous and their prices are so cheap,2
on a recent saturday night i was with a group of 5 at the bread bar,1
food is great and inexpensive,2
the price very reasonable,2
dessert cant be missed so save room,1
it can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order but once the food is ordered you are in for a treat,1
take a good sense of humoran american express card with no limit walk out with a lollipopgift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road,2
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me,2
it was so bad i actually refused to pay for my food,0
i recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices,2
this is by far my favorite restaurant in nyc and i only wish it were more affordable so i could go more often,2
the staff was very attentive the ambience lovely and the food superb,2
i love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine even with no idea how to use them,2
the pizza and wine were excellentthe service toobut what really made this place was the backyard dining area,2
the frankenstein show was the best,2
the waiters are sweet the food is tasty and the bill is never too large,2
as a fan of thai i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst,0
the service was superb they treat you like family,2
we all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews i felt there was more than enough food,2
it only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table but standing up wasnt too bad,2
the menu may be small but everything on it is delicious,2
too bad latin quarters closed,0
they had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice result we had large chunks of burnt rice in our serving bowl,0
it was divine melts in your mouth,2
stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and i will be going back frequently,2
i live a block away and go to patsys frequently,1
for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato with espresso which were tasty but i thought a bit overpriced,2
when i visited my friend who lives in the upper eastside she recommended that we go to this restaurant,2
warm comfortable surroundings nice appointments witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms,2
we ran a little late for the reservation but it wasnt a problem to get our table immediately,1
kudos haru,1
we arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptlythe,1
i plan on eating here more often,1
i would definitely go back for a very special occasion but not for regular fine dining,2
the well mannered pleasant staff that tony has in his employ,2
the flavors robust and subtle,2
i came here for my friends birthday and keep coming back ever since,2
all i can say is 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters youll find in the city though the quality is some of the best,2
i would never wait for a table to eat it just is not that great,0
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake both were delicious,2
the counter service is bad,0
i had a grat time at jekyll and hyde,2
service here was great food was fantastic,2
its a little out of the way if you dont live in the neighborhood but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are,2
this is such a lovely peaceful place to eat outside,2
and we were thouroughly disapointed,0
this is the jackel and hideof the restaurants on the ues,1
the sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect,2
this is a great place to take outoftowners and perfect for watching the sunset,2
since my first dinner i have had the chance to have brunch at orsay 3x,1
you will pay a lot for the decore but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other chinese and asian fusion places in ny,0
they have some great entrees here as well,2
our teenage kids love it too,2
the service is not consistently excellent just decent,0
the food served in small tasting portions as an option is very good with each dish being better than the next,2
you guys are awesome,2
they do cater to american palates but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige,2
i loved this place,2
i had the mango chicken and i cant go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful,2
i care more about the food and ambience,1
oh but wait we were out of drinks which were also delightfully overpriced,0
avoid at all costs,1
i would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion,2
the service is fantastic,2
i recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon,2
the garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city,2
food and service was okay,2
great for a romantic evening or a fun evening with friends,2
the lamb meat was undercooked and extrmely chewy,0
the best pad thai ive ever had,2
over time the food quality has decreased substantially it is a lot less crowded than it used to and the service must definitely be part of the reason,0
great pizza and fantastic service,2
we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date,0
i would just ask for no oil next time,1
while this is a pretty place in that overly cute french way the food was insultingly horrible,0
i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read,0
i really didnt know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of grand central,0
none of that yucky whipped stuff,0
the wine list isnt great and the desserts are shipped in from brunos down the street which is not as good as it used to be,0
i ordered a lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it,0
their coffee is quite good too,2
i would not recommend this place to anyone,0
great wine list italian good food service was initially fine,2
despite the fact that the space is large theyve overcrowded the floor with tables,0
i know you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored but my agenda is im here to eat and enjoy the company of friends seeking a pleasant experience,2
as far as the service goes the waitresses were not particularly friendly but they got the job done,1
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place but also become hostile,0
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested,1
normally that would be improper however they were all delicious and my host did not complain,2
taxan delicious,2
perhaps it was an off night but it was suprisingly average for a 93 rating,1
unlike other places in nyc where the sandwiches you want only come as a tripledecker here you can get what you want in a reasonablysized portion and price,1
southern indian cuisine is still there too,1
restaurant snobs need not bother this is a small neighborhood kind of place,0
have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience,2
they couldnt even make a salad that was appealing,0
for two people with tip was less than 25 bucks,1
killer sushi,1
of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious,2
staffs are not that friendly but the taste covers all,0
the jukebox plays everything from italian opera to the strokes,1
and ive been to many nyc delis,1
this place is always packed,0
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you,0
plus they made a perfect martini,2
i am not sure if i would call the food here indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be french with an indian or exotic touch,1
ive eaten thai many times and am very familiar with the cuisine,2
the waiter was attentive,2
their margarita is best ive had since ive returned from naples,2
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night,2
the tastes makes your mouth water for more,2
i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband,2
their sake list was extensive but we were looking for purple haze which wasnt listed but made for us upon request,1
the tables are crammed way too close the menu is typical of any italian restaurant and the wine list is simply overpriced,0
all in all a wonderful experience cant wait to come back,2
the food was actually aweful,2
after dining at bog over twenty times now its official,1
they are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch,2
there is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner,2
we went around 930 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great,2
my husband and i both ordered the steak medium,1
furthermore the rice had no seasoning so the sushi was bland and disgusting,0
this place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of japanese classic cuisine,2
the sushi is average and the prices are anything but,0
my wife and i also enjoyed the spinach the shanghai low mein and other attractions,2
owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit,1
turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down,1
i would go back,2
definitely will be back,2
several of the dim sum orders had about 68 pieces,1
im not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much,0
they live up to the thai way of living,1
if you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here,1
three page wine menu one page entree and horedevous,1
the food is consistently wonderful ive been coming here for years and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly,2
the waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but werent as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected,1
i live nearby and when they first opened i ate there a lot,1
and the food was fantastic,2
this is the kind of place youd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret,1
if youre looking for a place to sit down have a drink and conversations with friends go to sweetntart and order yourself a hongkong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls hot,1
aside from the sea urchin the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail boton shrimp blue fin torro fatty tuna sea eel etc,1
theyre also friendlier here especially the owner kenny,2
while the room is not particularly comfortable once youre seated youll forget about everything except whats on your plate,0
ive lived in nyc all my life and had never before seen so many waterbugs in one place except in a really bad dream,0
winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you,2
the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal but some dishes are quite good such as the eggplant parmesan veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca,2
my host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered but some other items that were not ordered,1
you can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge,1
the bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher 2 for 1s,1
slightly on the pricey side but worth it,2
if it isnt for the food a it must be the service or the ambience,1
during the course of the past 3 months the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better,0
i like the ambience its very dark and original,2
not the typical nyc gimmick theme restaurant,1
we were exploring grand central and didnt want to eat in the food court,0
overall not worth the money,0
this place is not worth the prices,0
we left after one drink,1
everything that happened was not even up to mediocre,0
our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy,0
pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city,2
you are paying for the atmosphere which is nice but can be had in numerous places in bay ridge,2
its called gnochi alla nona and is found under chef specials,1
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in nyi am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country,2
yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken,1
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish,0
the fried dumplings are great,2
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city,2
ive been here so many times the waiters know my name,1
the decor is very simple but comfortable,2
ive been frequenting the tasting room since it first arrived in the east village and ive never been disappointed,2
we figured we never had argentinian pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there sharing a large pelligrino a pizza of two of their specials one was goat cheese the other blue cheese and both were excellent,2
heartland brewery is a great way to start or finish your day,2
the kamasutra and bombay cosmopolitan are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time,2
this is the perfect date spot for williamsburg couples,2
the dim sum here is only soso,1
it was raining and we figured why not,1
6 and there is much tasty food all of it fresh and continually refilled,2
just straight up cheap good food,2
another welcome addition to the neighborhood,2
seating is ok even though sometimes theres alot of people,2
this time i prefer not to go into detail,1
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine if you can call 7000 inexpensive the cost is through the roof for better than average fare,1
service was slow but the people were friendly,2
steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table,2
the steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty,0
my only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you,0
and affordable,1
the staff makes you feel at home the food is great and the atmosphere is wonderful,2
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret,1
the food is alright some stuff is good some is not like the steak dish which tends to be dry,2
not only would i not recommend jimmys restaurants to friends i would strongly suggest they go anywhere but,1
they have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody,2
haru on park s is simply disgusting,0
the staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check,0
as a longtime patron of mamouns i always figured that i had found the best late night food spot in the city,2
i drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at scores,1
the bagel was huge,2
go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else,2
get the tuna of gari,1
i like the somosas chai and the chole but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing,0
it was a very nice surprise,2
edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area,0
the staff has been nice but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often,1
i am french and i really felt like home,2
i have been to casimir over 5 times and i have always had a great time there,2
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant,2
its usually packed for good reason esp,2
service friendly and attentive,2
i love going there,2
i cannot recommend og more highly if i tried check it out for yourself,2
it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york,1
service was very prompt but slightly rushed,1
great food great decor great service,2
and atlhough tables opened up next to us and we asked for a slightly larger space they left us awkardly seated,1
the palak paneer was standard and i was not a fan of the malai kofta,0
ive dined at alain ducasses restaurant in monte carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience,2
yeah sometimes the service can be slow,0
there was no ambiance,1
save your money and dont waste your calories go to margharitas on washington street instead they have amazing food and the best service,2
the service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura,2
but trust me it is so worth it,2
it is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in bay ridge,0
the perfect spot,2
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4 which makes no sense whatsoever,0
they sell special sushi everything have a topping sauce and etc,1
do not try unless youre just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste,0
they never came back to refill our glasses again,0
the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded but the service is excellent and its great for friends out a romantic date or a special occassion,2
service was also very good,2
i took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing really good meal,2
i would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it but they were not,0
theyre rude at times and not very friendly,0
im happy to have nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting,2
good atmosphere combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on fridays,2
they kindly brought us more to see if it was better but it was not,1
love the food,2
i would highly recommend ninas to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures,2
all the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews,2
theres something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style,2
its a nice place to relax and have conversation,2
this place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area,2
best reuben sandwich ever,2
lucky strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat,2
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well,2
going to volare is like going to your favorite aunts house for dinner assuming that your aunt is a great italian cook,2
the sushi has been from average to below average the wait service has always been subpar the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen the acousitcs are horrid everything echoes is extremely loud,0
i loved it and would go again,2
frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side,2
so so so so so good,2
alone for 100 bucks it is really overprice,0
out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens this is among the best,2
very good value,2
here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid,1
i would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time,1
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork,2
i keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table i can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people,2
overall the best bagel in town,2
everything a ny pizza joint should be,1
it was huge delicious fresh and will be the reason we return,2
we go often,1
light refreshing summer rolls not fried remind me of vietnamese places in paris,2
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned,2
moral stay away,1
but the service was a bit slow,0
spreads and toppings are great though a bit pricey,2
when i saw that their website had a link to da ciro in napoli i knew there was going to be good pizza,2
no one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates,1
indoor was very cozy and cute,2
we had a 3 hour brunch they definitely do not rush you and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time,2
and their prices are very high they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service,0
theyre terrific,2
the service was excellent the food was excellent but the entire experience was very cool,2
the service is good and the resturant is clean,2
great spot whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner,2
just stick with the small dishes,1
the cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables but the service could have been better,2
ive rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years ive been going,1
food is excellent,2
this place is a literal holeinthewall that is buried within doyers right off of pell st barbers alley in chinatown,0
they outshine hh,2
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great,2
excellent lunch buffet for only 695,2
we were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past,2
if youre not familiar with the cuisine you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they dont accept credit cards,0
both are very reasonably priced around 8 for dinner and 5 for lunch and are delicious and filling,2
problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable,0
ambience is so cute and quaint good for business although we were there on vacation,2
the portion sizes here are huge and the sushi is good,2
just wish theyd expand,1
my boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly,2
this wasnt the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup but i thought that was what made the place so special,2
good food at the restaurant a bit expensive but great if you want to impress your date,2
i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service,2
you cant say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown,1
i have eaten there 34 times and the food was always good,2
keep up the good work,2
i wasnt thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes but i guess thats the price you pay for a popular place,0
great eats good times,2
make sure you try this place as often as you can,2
grilled whole fish wonderful great spicing,2
for years i thought tuscan cuisine was the best but salvatore converted me to the hearty neapolitan fare on my first visit,2
plus when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy saturday night the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over,1
the service was great as well,2
try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll,1
another plus is most of the entrees are approx,2
i will go back to suan soon,1
loved it,2
the food was delicious the atmosphere was relaxed and we have now adopted plate 347 as our secret on second,2
we were pleasantly surprised,2
from the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed,2
it is loud hot and dark,1
i found the food service and value exceptional everytime i have been there,2
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods,0
the food is definitely good but i left a bit disappointed,1
i am a 100 lb girl had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner and i was still hungry after my visit to this place,1
the drinks are a saving grace but service staff please get over yourselves,2
there is a downside if youre ordering in the delivery guys have major attitude,0
will give it another chance before i write it off,1
the allitalian staff is warm and engaging from the start,2
village is one of those places that scores on all fronts,1
the prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber,2
if you go here your focus should be the tamarind margaritas,1
it is the best hidden spot there and i rave about it to everyone,2
the filet mignon dish was superb,2
i had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table,2
cant wait wait for my next visit,2
this place is the most japanese it can ever get,1
the food is good i cant lie,2
great food lts of it more then one person can eat,2
i didnt expect to like nosh as much as i did but the pastrami on challah sandwich i had was otherworldly the soups are like moms and the knishes give yonah schimmels a run for its money,1
the atmosphere is nothing special but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo,1
cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most,1
this place is worth going even if only for their beer,2
i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi on saffron risottoyum,2
the ambience was so fun and the prices were great on top of the fact that the food was really tasty,2
do not get the go go hamburgers no matter what the reviews say,0
the sandwhiches are outofthis world,0
if you live in upper manhattan siam square is the place for thia food,2
decor is charming,2
the food was very well prepared,2
really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though,2
stay away from this place,0
good because hey its more food but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap,1
while most people can attest to spending over 50 on drinks in new york bars and hardly feeling a thing the drinks here are plentiful and unique,2
complimentary stuff kept coming and when the waiter saw me opening a gift i received my dessert on a plate that had happy birthday written on it with a candlevery nice touch and attentive staff,2
the food arrived 20 minutes after i called cold and soggy,1
if you go for the pretheatre menu its an even greater deal,2
the one up front will smile and say what can i get for you brother,2
brava la pizza fresca,1
if you are someone who appreciates simplicity elegance and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size kai is your place,2
the prices cannot be beat for the quality quantity freshness and taste,2
check it out it wont hurt your stomach or your wallet,1
if just to drop in quickly stuff yourself and jet out to keep their turnover,1
little toninos is just awesome our favorite delivery place in kennsington honestly the best gnochi i have ever had,2
incredibly poor service an food quality at exorbitant prices,0
i have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal,2
i go back in line like three times on average until i cant walk anymore,0
we usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty,2
horrible food and horrible service,0
the wine and cheese plate are plentiful and cant wait to try the fondue or table grilling,2
bleecker st pizza is the best,2
i do not recommend the heartland brewery,0
they treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and wellprepared,2
their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu,2
the big complaint no toasting available,0
even if the food wasnt this good the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax,2
volare virgins or weekly regulars everyone gets treated the same and you cant ask for more than that when the service is this friendly,1
the food came out wrong the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal,0
the chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites,2
faan is sooo good,2
we saw them heating up at least one frozen item though im not sure which dim sum dish it was,1
no youre going to go back because the food was good,2
the food was great and the service was even better,2
while this can hardly be called a restaurant it is possibly the best deal in manhatten 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 23 entrees,2
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation,1
the fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt,2
consequently their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they didnt feel like finishing them,0
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge,2
i really recommend the very simple unda egg rolls,2
i will not be coming here at 3am again,0
very good wine choices,2
this is the only thai place i go too in nyc its wonderful and live relaxed jazz on certain nights,2
we were seated and ignored by waitstaff,0
if you are in a big group this place is perfect because it recomends sharing they have lazy susans on most tables even families can feel comfortable here,2
they showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt,1
tasty steak pork loin the works,1
i went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didnt feel rushed at all even though there was a wait,2
i went to ruby foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there,2
id highly recommend it for a special occasion it provides and intimate setting and nice service,2
the burger was great also,2
they did give a 15 discount at the end wasnt enough as they knew the service was horrible,0
just because its cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty it is great,2
the pizza was great,2
and everytime i go theres a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front,0
i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty couldve used a bit more salt,2
however its the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth,0
when we notified him that he didnt mention the specials he didnt apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless,2
the price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate,2
dont dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes they are simply not up to par with the nonveg selections,0
kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family,2
they need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent,2
ive had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait,2
all in all the food was above average and i would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners,1
judging from previous posts this used to be a good place but not any longer,0
delicious food excellent service and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the 599 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch,2
for appetizers i recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings,2
and cheap,1
such nice people working here but i have to review the food,2
the restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible reaching for sunglasses,0
try the times square cocktail ginger lemonade with vodka also available without vodka,1
nice find,2
veal parmigana better than patsys,1
great wine great food,2
the service was mediocre and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal,0
the food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to,2
amazing,2
went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza as i love la pizza fresca,2
ive always been seated propmtly,1
we try frequenting new restaurants all over the city but any time that we visit a restaurant other than roths we are always disappointed,0
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives,0
there is nothing more pleasant than that,2
i would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again,2
however if you want great food at a great price and dont mind the decor you cant beat this place,2
what makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in nyc that offers authentic chongqing hotpot,2
mizu is the japenese find in grammercy,1
for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves,2
our tiny table for two dinner plates hung over edge was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic,1
sake collection was excellent try nanbu bijin but pricy,2
interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole,2
one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood,2
one of my favorites though was the angry lobster a cold lobster salad that was magnificent,2
i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood,2
ask for usha the nicest bartender in manhattan,2
the service is outstanding and my crabcake eggs benedict could not have been better,2
the places decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh,2
this is a true gem of the village,2
its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable makes students go back to suan again and again,2
however i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once,2
they treat me like family morning and night,2
a wonderful place,2
please take my advice go and try this place,1
service was on par but not wonderful,0
for my birthday and we had an excellent time,2
deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area,0
i went to amma after a friend recommended it,1
im just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud,0
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids,1
maybe tomorrow,1
we also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them,2
please dont fool us,0
ive had the chicken with garlic sauce chicken with black bean sauce and hunan chicken,1
because of the delicate thin crust takeout pies get soggy in their boxes,0
i suspect this restaurant is what raos would be if it hadnt turned exclusive,1
the dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it,1
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you or with the local union worker on the other side,1
we were then shooed inside,1
we got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter,1
it might have been a little too spicy for my friend which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand,0
this place is always very crowded and popular,2
appetizers are somewhere around 7 each and the main dishes are between 11 and 16,1
really depends on your luck,1
just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday,1
my wife and i went to orsay for valentines dinner,1
i dont know about you guys but when i go somewhere to eat i go for the food not for the atmosphere,1
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chipsgood but a far cry from what the name implies,0
a gentleman maybe the manager came to our table and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order,1
very different than regular dimsum places,1
i have lived in ny for many years and have dined at many restaraunts,1
when you enter you feel like you have entered your moms kitchen,1
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers,1
ive had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer,1
she lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy,1
he was terribly thirsty after the meal too,0
and when i visit her i make it a point to eat at ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip,1
i wasnt there for the halfprice saturday night special but tuesday night,1
in fact it appears he is going to go postal at any moment,1
there was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at pastis,1
for meetball night,1
if you like the food and the value you get from some of chinatown restaurants this is not the place for you,0
they are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey,1
want to impress,1
the selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available,1
weve lived in the area for more than 8 years,1
get the soup and a nosh pastrami sandwich for 8 and youre golden,2
i have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch i dont mind,1
my family and i ate here last night for our annual christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends outoftown,1
i grew up on these bagels,1
we were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available,1
the restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must,1
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews,1
a one women show,1
you cant go wrong here,1
at first i was rolling my ideas of yet another french place on the ues,1
to my right the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido rapido as he tried to clear and reset a table for six,1
in china the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud,1
after dealing with subpar pizza all over the kensington neighborhood ive found little toninos,0
i thought this place was totally overrated,0
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi,1
you wont find that anywhere in manhattan,1
how do you rate home,1
i went here in the afternoon with a friend,1
our first greeting when we entered was the last call is at 1015,1
interior was so so,0
im partial to the gnocchi,1
i guess the way my friends and i described it was the french colonies,1
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me theyd treat us well for the occasion,2
boy was i wrong,0
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke,1
note that they do not serve beer you must bring your own,0
we ate outside at harus sake bar because harus restaurant next door was overflowing,1
when we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years,1
ahhh,1
better than the bagel shop on the corner but not worth going out of your way for in my opinion,1
it helps if you know what to order,1
the service was typical shortorder dinner type,1
we shared a bottle of sake an order of edamames and she had the sushi plate while i had the sashimi,1
i cant believe people complain about no cheese sticks,0
but that is highly forgivable,0
from the appetizers we ate the dim sum and other variety of foods it was impossible to criticize the food,1
when we arrived at 600 pm the restaurant was practically empty,1
each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface and you get platters of thin sliced meats various vegetables and rice and glass noodles,1
i am going to the mid town location next,1
experienced staff and had a memorable stay,2
india as a country has always fascinated me and all of my friends who have been there always have wonderful things to say about it,2
one of my friends who had been there before was planning a weeklong trip to rajasthan in india and i decided to join him this time,1
yes it really was a great experience and we visited various places but the most wonderful part of the trip was our stay at the oberoi udaivilas luxury hotel,2
i can t explain in words how grand this place looks,2
it is a unique blend of the old world royal charm and the modern luxuries,2
i m definitely going there again whenever i get a chance,2
bit pricey and but away from center,1
you need to count 20 30 minutes walking time to get to dubling city center from this hotel,1
there is no sauna nor swimming pool,1
flat tv with discovery but no hbo,1
in my room mattress was ok and it was quiet but i had room with view on wall most of colleagues were complaining for the mattresses being old and some for noises from outside train in particular,1
service on the other hand was very good and the stuff is quite international,2
but still i had to ask for the welcome drink voucher,1
we ve got special price of 160 eur night normal price was 199 eur night including breakfast,1
i think it s too much for what it offers,0
relax in the city,1
perfect hotel to discover köln just out of the real center only 2 stops with the u bahn,2
easy to reach by car and there are enough parking places,2
the wellness facilities are perfect but can be crowded on saturday,2
clean renewed rooms,1
quite comfortable hotel in excellent location,2
have stayed at the carlton in amsterdam quite a number of times,1
have also stayed in other hotels and to me nh carlton is definitely the best,2
very close to flower market pathé cinema bars for every kind very convenient nearby tram stop,2
breakfast in superbly decorated and furnished lounge is delicious though somewhat overcharged so try to book your room at the nh carlton breakfast included and view on the city is great,2
rooms are spacious and neatly decorated,2
dam square is only a few minutes walk or 2 tram stops away,1
a definitely highly recommended hotel,2
titanic mutinee,0
clean sizeable room with good facilities in the part of the hotel we were in,2
there were larger and smaller rooms than ours,1
we were in the 2300 range of rooms,1
food very basic,0
although edible it was very very borring,0
the all inclusive spirits had a perfume taste to them,1
vodka rum brandy whisky although were diffrent had a similar perfume flavouring,1
i know some people complained,0
service of all staff was wonderful,2
but a lot of them let you know they wanted tips,1
there were a rody russian contingent at the hotel which broke out in fighting on at least one occassion,1
beautiful honeymoon,2
the hotel is easily one of the classiest establishments i have ever had the honor of staying at,2
the staff was extremely friendly the layout was superb the architecture was elegant and the sea was literally a few steps from our hotel room,2
beautiful views were only made more beautiful by this hotel s landscape architecture and friendly staff,2
cheap and noisy hotel with good location,2
the hotel is located near place de opera in a side street,1
the location is probably the only good thing about this hotel,2
it is noisy thin walls doors i woke up several times because i thought someone was entering my rooms smelly very small and dirty,0
i was glad that i didn t have to take a shower in there the bath tub was dirty and used,2
even though the price is decent for paris i would not recommend this hotel,0
basic hotel outside the amsterdam,1
quite ok hotel next to amsterdammajor advantage is free parking and subway station within 8 mins walk,2
there is nothing but highway close to hotel,1
in 5 minutes drive you can find mcdonalds,2
very well conected to amsterdam city center 8 min walk 25 mins subway,2
our best holiday stay ever so far,2
we have just arrived from this marvelous place,2
we had experienced our best holiday stay ever so far,2
we have been very plaesantly surprised we liked the overall location and the hotel itself even more we had expected to do so based on the reviews and photos available online,2
we would like to stress the preciseness and quality of tha staff s services especially in the restaurant,1
special thanks to the animators oscar mehmet dasha katya anna maryem and sabri that made a great effort to keep us entertained all days and nights long,2
thank you guys it was great fun,2
hope to see you and this great place again,2
good hotel for a business trip,2
overall good hotel,2
nice lounge on the top floor,2
the room was clean big air conditioning,2
there is a little gym in the first floor,1
the breakfast is correct,2
the wifi internet connection is good,2
best for couples extra tips for you,1
the hotel looks spectacular,2
it is very colorful and perfect for a romantic getaway,2
i have been staying in the older part of the hotel and i have been told that they just opened the new wing that week,1
they could work a little on dusting the place better some of the lamps and decorative items were full of dust,0
some of the items in the room looked old and cracked the chair was damaged the cabinets looked re purposed,0
this should not by any means deter you from staying,1
it is a wonderful romantic cozy spot where you could cuddle with your darling in the most dreamy way,2
the bed was exceptionally comfy,2
guests are 20 35 yo,1
good location but expect better from this chain,2
it s in a pretty good location just a few steps from the strip right behind flamingo,2
that was a huge plus for us as you can really easily walk all places of interest,2
however the bathroom door were broken and they messed up our reservation not good after 11pm when we were already tired from a whole day spend in vegas but compensated for that with a voucher to spend on food shopping in the hotel,0
no balcony cannot open windows,0
problems can happen at any place of course so i d say you can stay there as the location is pretty good and maybe someone else s experience will be better but i ve stayed in better hotels of theirs,2
my best honeymoon,2
this is a seven star hotel,1
i would call it as rixos super premium,1
the suprise for honeymooners was very special to us,2
all the entertainment a tourist would like to have from music tournaments swimming pools beaches video games cinema etc are available,2
rooms are very clean,2
employees are very helpful and kind and do their best to keep customers comfortable especially mr ihsan,2
he was very nice,2
the employees know most of world main languages english german russian arabic etc the last thing that i would like to say is you can find all kinds of food from different regions of the world,1
very recommendable b b with extremely kind staff,2
it is part of an old palazzo recently renovated and adjusted to modern standards including free wifi,1
it has 6 large rooms on the first floor each with a different name of a flower,1
although the entrance of the building is in front of the via di pantaneto a road with less traffic nearly all rooms are at the rear with a splendid view at siena s countryside,2
to enter the b b you have to climb 20 steps to reach the first floor so the b b is less accustomed to handicapped people,1
there is no elevator but the owners a young couple are very willing to help you with your luggage,2
paradise on earth,1
we felt us on our holiday like in paradise,2
the friendly welcome in the hotel the generous size of the room the cleanliness overal the big size of the room and the bathroom was very great,2
the location and surrounding is very lovely arranged,2
we were very suprised over the staffs knowledge of foreign languages,2
the weather was every day fine the beach was great,2
we liked the generous variety of food at the different restaurants,2
we would like to visit the dana beach resort again,2
a great thank to the whole staff of dana beach,2
it was a great pleasure to be with you,2
best holiday we have had in years,2
the hotel is very clean and tidy it is in a beautiful setting and very spacious,2
we had two rooms next to each other on the ground floor looking out to the pools,1
we preferred to use the sunrise restaurant apposed to the sentido as we found the service much better and the air conditioning worked better although both had the same food with we think could have been better as the meals were aimed more for the russians and egyptians,2
the guests were mostly russians and egyptians and only a few english most of them were families with young children that took over the pool area,1
good value for money,2
very good value for money competent and friendly personnel willing to help and offer a good service,2
excellent room space and cleanliness,2
very good restaurant and bar,2
the location is excellent too close to the central square which makes it very easy to walk around,2
breakfast is not bad but not as good as food in the restaurant however the coffee is not good,0
wifi is free but not stable making it annoying when you lose connection and have to login again,0
centrally located but low value hotel,1
for 160 without breakfast i believe i should get a decent room also in paris but this was not the case,1
the room size is unbearable and the bathroom is even smaller,0
asked for an iron than never arrived they offered me access to the full continental breakfast what a shame and they even charge some 13 for that,0
not recommended at all,0
titanic beach spa aqua park,1
during my stay here at titanic i had a nice welcome by the reseption and the general mangers then we had a nice meet again with the animation staff we had a nice big room for us as a couple and a nice pool view the dinner was always nice there was never a nite were we could not find something to eat the hotel was well looked after and the bar staff and waiters were all help full,2
the great thing we found this time around we had a welsh animator to speak with if he had any problems,2
good but the restaurant is a dive,0
for fast in and out as business traveller for a couple of days it is ok but key hotel and swisshotel are far better and offer more for the business traveller in terms of service,2
the sports pool area is boring and small,0
only plus is the view of the city from the fitness room,2
the roof top bar is great and unmatched by other hotels,2
the restaurant is ok for breakfast but incredibly boring for lunch and dinner,0
sensational located superfriendly hotel,2
top of the tops,2
the staff was frienly and the rooms were new renovarted in a luxury modern style very clean and fine a lot of opportunitys possible and an ideal hotel for a buiseness stay or city trip,2
excellent hotel service,2
very happy with food,2
ignore the complainers,0
if you are one dont expect macdonalds or fish chips if you go to a foreign country,0
the five free restaurants gave an excellent choice of food although beach bar was just chips burgers hotdogs occasional bbq fish and salad,2
all staff very friendly and service was excellent,2
these were the typical views of the vast majority of british people we spoke to at the location too,1
booked through flights and packages who were excellent,2
nicest hotel ever,2
this was my favourite holiday place i have ever been to,2
will definitely be retuning advise people to go here for a great holiday,2
people are great,2
staff are great and the whole holiday package was fantastic,2
definitely not a five star hotel,0
first impression was good,2
excellent check in and given all information needed,2
then started realizing that the money we paid were far too much for what we got,0
all staff excellent and always willing to help but lack of management and easy to see that services not even close to 5 star,2
choice of food very poor not enough staff so employees were running like crazy and you could tell there is a lack of management,0
5 stars,1
great design hotel where every detail is looked after,2
the villa was very spacious with living room with private terrace fantastic bathroom and a really nice bed,2
staff was always happy to comply with our wishes,2
absolutely unique pools,2
excellent restaurants offering a wide range,2
they steal your stuff,0
in 2011 i stayed there with my fam,1
i bought a pair of converse sneakers,1
i thought it would be safe to keep them in my room,1
the next day i found out that my new converse were stolen,0
the manager of the hotel didn t do anything,0
he promised me he would contact me but he never did,0
i will not recommend this hotel to anyone,0
and they will never have me as a guest again,0
never again,0
loud and noisy despite rule tat fron 22 00 everything must be quit staff says bad luck also staaf was responsible for serious damage on my motorcycle which was put in a bike shed only they could enter,0
no adequate respons to that,1
so same price as cheap hotel crappy room food is horrible we left it and went into town for food no night rest and a few 100 euro damage on motorbike,0
level club at melia,1
it s michel and pamela,1
we took the package of the honeymooners and we spent one of the best holidays ever,2
having the level member offer we had several vip services free mini bar refilled bottle of wine as a welcoming reception vip restaurant for breakfast free lounge bar access alcohol sweets tea coffee discount on several things restaurant laundry shopping areas clubs,2
vip area at the pool and in the garden special spa treatment and many other special services,1
the service at the level lounge bar was amazing there was a hostess named anna she was so friendly smart very elegant and treated us as vips,2
she deserves an excellent rating too,2
overall all the stay was wow as we have amazing 8 days at a luxurious hotel,2
we will surely visit it again next summer,2
cozy french hotel near to monmarte,1
it was really cozy french style hotel because it was small but still quite nice if you don t expect much of a hotel,2
it really inspires to go out and spend more time at the city and paris is worth to explore definitely,2
monmarte is really near about 1mile so it great to walk around hotel and this part of the city is not so crowded so location is excellent,2
metro buses and train stations are near,1
staff is not the most positive persons in the world but still helpful and understanding if you need something,2
for business trips as well as for short stays great place to stay at,2
as a hh diamond i booked a standard guest room and got upgraded to an executive room,1
even though the hotel is build in the 70s everything was in good shape,2
lobby executive lounge and room left a good impression,2
the rooms are on the smaller side but again my room seemed to be in good shape,2
as a diamond you get the choice of breakfast either in the exec,1
lounge or restaurant,1
as i had a very early flight i did not get a chance to try the breakfast,0
checkin was fast convenient and friendly,2
with a rate of 95 the price was good food an airport hotel,2
would recommend when in transit,2
the most enjoyable vacation for me and family,2
it s one of the best holidays we ever had in hurghada,2
we decided to visit dana beach resort again in our next holiday,1
thanks to the friendly stuff excellent management it was the best holiday,2
marriott standard but room was not clean enough,0
location 2 blocks form the beach in the heart of art deco district,1
room size was good but i had impression that it was not cleaned properly perhaps because we asked and got early check in,0
bathroom was rather small but washbasin was in the room which i thought was a great idea,2
in the room there was coffee machine,1
i can not rate breakfast as we did not eat there but there is little shop in the lobby where you can buy food all the time,0
i loved rooftop swimming pool,2
it was not big but view was nice there were towels and relaxation area there,2
reception staff was very friendly,2
ideal for late arrivals,1
i often travel to paris with our head office being located at stade de france,1
my usual mo is to fly in on the last flight the night before arriving at cdg around 10pm and then stay at the novotel which is at t1 for the cdgval basically a monoral that connects all of the terminals,1
then first thing in the morning i can get up have breakfast and then take the rer b directly outside the door of the hotel 25m from the door straight to my office or into paris,1
i personally will not take the rer late at night as i do not feel it s safe,0
three stars stated but where,1
this hotel has only one great thing the friendly staff,2
it is worn down not clean and the whole hotel looks like a mess,0
the only positive is that they are offering free internet in the lobby some welcome drinks buffet and friendly reception staff,2
location is close to the station but this hotel was all in all quite an unpleasant experience looking into the hotel hardware,0
room tip best rooms are in another hotel not there,1
ancient charme outside very modern inside,1
great place to stay for extended weekend,2
perfect location allows to visit all interested places in barcelona,2
as breakfast in the hotel was an expensive option we decided to go to famous cafe zurich 100 meters only every morning and enjoy lovely weather and many peple going around,2
while staying in the place you have easy access to hop hop bus tour coach to the airport and corte d ingles which is wonderful store,2
hotel interior is very modern and elegant,2
our room was unfortunately very small but the bed were very comfortable linen very clean,2
we had perfect time while staying in regina,2
definitely can be highly recommended,2
18th century luxury with modern comfort,1
the old villa was recently restored and it was great to have all modern comforts in the luxury of an 18th century palace,2
the room was ideal for a romantic stay large comfortable bed separate furnished dressing room and well equipped bathroom,2
although we did not have dinner in the very elegant restaurant we had a great breakfast with a lot of choice and a view on the splendid surrounding gardens,2
would recommend having a car to visit the surroundings as the village where the hotel is located is rather small and uninteresting which makes you want to spend even more time in this beautiful hotel,2
economically priced hotel,1
this is just a hostel if you want to save money for your stay,1
i enjoyed the central location it was very near to the barcelona s main touristic street la rambla,2
there is no lift it s very difficult to climb upper floors with your luggage through the narrow stares,0
hardly i ll stay in this hotel again but in general i liked it,2
great stay at ibis bilbao in november,2
it is one of the ibis chain hotels and as such it offers a business oriented services everything is clean the amenities are well known at the time of booking,2
not a place for family with kids or if you are used at 4 5 comfort,0
the place is good enough for couples in leisure holidays or for business trips,2
great location not far from the city centers and we never needed any bus ride during our stay,2
many restaurants are close by the receptionists have been happy to give a recommendation about cheap place to eat and the best neighborhoods for pintxos hopping,2
in a few yrs maybe,1
fab location and great views management could be better some parts of the hotel were dirty whole public areas needs refurb bit tired restaurant was good as long as feyyoz was our server he was very attentive and made us laugh alwys got us drinks when we sat down and always made us welcome ala carte italian was awful so we didnt try the others but heard the fish one was good service at the bar was very slow they were more interested in washing up,2
we had great time and would go back in a few years when it has been refurbed and better management,2
really poor food at this hotel for brits,0
hi just got back from the mamlouk palace the hotel looks every bit of a five star hotel however on close inspection its more like an average 2 3 star,1
the egyptian people are so friendly and happy to talk to you there s a really nice atmosphere in the hotel itself even though the other guests can be so rude mainly russians its lovely and clean but the food is very very poor breakfast was cold most days and if honest they really don t cater for brits,2
although i wouldn t say this was a cheap holiday it didn t break the bank either so if you want a guaranteed tan go to egypt if not and its your main summer yearly holiday i wouldn t recommended it i d go somewhere else to avoid disappointment,1
best hotel we have been to,2
this hotel has everything,2
everything is very clean and well looked after staff are very friendly and helpfull lots do do all in all its an excellent place to stay we will be going back soon,2
treated like royalty,1
the hotel was a little bit shabby on first appearances but the room was absolutely fine,2
the beds were changed daily and the cleaners added little extras like positioning my son s teddy in different ways and making animals of the towels,1
because there are so few english who stay here the staff are delighed to talk to you,1
they made a point of giving us the best sun beds and towels etc and were telling the russians there was no beer then bringing out special bottles for us,2
the food was a disappointment although there was plenty of variety,0
it was all overcooked and luke warm,0
good budget option on strip bit rundown,2
i went with my father and we found a deal online that was too good to pass up,2
i think the luxor was a much better hotel 10 or 20 years ago but it seems a bit run down now,1
still decent option though if you want to be on the strip for a good price,2
cheap but that is it,1
my girlfriend and i arrived early in the night after a long day of paris,1
as we were checking in we heard the uproar from the first floor and out came a half naked woman standing while a man was running after her and yelled and screamed until other guests came out and stopped him,0
scary,0
in addition the room was in quite disgusting condition and the bathroom is like a toilet trailer that has been placed in the room,0
we decided to make do with as little sleep as possible and ran as fast again,1
but if you re looking for a bed and nothing else this is a possibility,1
check in is at a machine which disclose your room card key and there is thus no reception at least not at night,1
antwerp lindner may 2013,1
comfortable modern hotel close to central rail station in antwerp and shops and restaurants,2
hotel room was too warm air conditioning not powerful enough to cool room,0
no ironing board and iron in room small table top board and non steam iron is supplied when requested but to be honest are useless for removing creases in cotton shirts,0
reasonable breakfast but no low fat options for milk yoghurt cereal etc compared to my recent visit to denmark scandic hotel,1
this is a big issue for me and i d like to see low fat options available,1
fruit choice is not large,1
i didn t try the cooked breakfast,0
i haven t tried the gym but been to see it quite small but new equipment available,1
super hotel perfect service poor beach,2
everything perfect but the beach too steep and dangerous waves red flag had to walk outside the hotel to have access,1
but we layed on the stretchers on the lawn with super service so it was not so bad,2
never again,0
this campsite is the most expensive i have ever stayed at with some of the smallest pitches,0
the ground is hard and the tent pegs do not stay in,0
the owner appeared friendly at first but then started shouting at me when she mistakenly thought that i had broken a piece of trimming of the side of her freezer,0
the redeeming feature is the location if you are interested in climbing it is in walking distance of a wide variety of climbs,2
however this does not make up for the expense and lack of space,0
beautiful hotel with amazing staff best holiday,2
the room was lovely cleaned really well everyday with a beautiful view food tasted good and there was lots of choice the hotel is the nicest i have ever stayed in and exceeded my expectations,2
nice,2
i was there at first dayw of june with my wife weekend and and for more days again in augoust with our chidren 18 15 years old,1
we all enjoyed a lot,2
i hope to be there next summer for more days,2
absolutely not value for the money,0
we were completely dissatisfied with the owners unfriendly attitude the room was a lot different from its foto in the hotel s internet site and the room was smelling as bad as being in a hospital,0
dana beach resort the place to stay in hurghada,1
nice spacious and yet compact hotel area with all the things you want for a beach holiday inside the hotel area,2
lots of restaurants to choose from friendly and humorous staff good facilities and some activities and peace and quiet for those who want that,2
mostly german guests 50 years old,1
some families with children also,1
not a partyplace in a good sence,1
a nightclub right across the street,1
a beautiful wellness hotel,2
two days wellness and a wonderful massage,2
the hotel is nice and clean and the service is great,2
the restaurant is good only for vegetarian there is too little choice,2
the sauna is a little bit small there are only two of them but clean and nice,2
excellent hotel,2
good situation,2
friendly staff,2
excellent hotel,2
well located for access to town,1
quiet location,1
were given a free room upgrade which made it even better,2
would stay again if revisiting the town,1
no problems whatsoever,1
relax,1
we stayed at villaggio il girasole for two weeks at the middle of july,1
the camping village is well looked after and provided with many comforts restourant supermarket bar two swimming pools one for adults and the other smaller for the children,2
it s situated in the middle of the pinewold there are a lot of mosquitos so bring along some lotion against them near the sea,1
the sea is beautiful the water is clean and trasparent,2
the cottages are very comfortable pretty and clean,2
at restourant you can eat typical tuscan food very good pizza was special,2
kind and friendly employes at the reception supermarket and bar,2
the atmosphere is very good,2
we are going to visit it again next year,2
good quality for price,2
the hotel has a good position close to the city center and the train station,2
quite some restaurants are in the surrondings with a good choice of food,2
the hotel doesn t have an internal restaurant however there are two options a small restaurant just next to it or the hallmark hotel restaurant just across the street discount applied to customers of the hallmark inn,1
noticeable the free parking for all hotel and inn customers,2
quality of the hotel inside is good rooms are simple but clean and furnished decently well,2
being a budget hotel the ration between costs and quality is fairly good and there s also free internet connection wifi only,2
best hotel,2
i ve been back to this hotel three times now as my experience each time was amazing the rooms are clean and comfortable and the hotel considering its 20 years old is in amazing condition,2
it s located on the end of the strip but do not let that put you off,1
this hotel is awesome,2
and the pool has no shadows on it at all,1
inclusive or all inclusive that is the question,1
lovely and clean nice rooms nice location,2
paaid for all inclusive but this was not exactly what i received for this i had to pay extra all inclusive to this hotel is meals in the main self sevice restaurant does not include any other restaurant on the site the local fish market evening was extra as well as the ala carte they do give you a rs375 off the ala carte menu which is an insult due to the price charged for self service,0
there is no wine included in the all inclusive not even with meals this has to be paid extra no liquires,0
you can pay exrra for these by paying for a gold all inclusive package,1
great hotel kind personnel delicious food,2
we got a two day trip to this hotel for our wedding so we didn t choose it ourselves,1
we re glad though that our friends picked this hotel,2
it s a very warm and comfy hotel which makes you feel at home right away,2
our room was small but sufficient,2
it was definitely clean which is most important to us,2
the bathroom was pretty new and also absolutely clean,2
we enjoyed breakfast and one dinner at the hotel and it was both great,2
we had a 4 month old baby with us and the personnel was very keen to find a good table for us and the stroller,2
there is a small park right next to the hotel which is nice to take a walk,2
the center of trier is just a 10 15 minute drive away,1
all in all we enjoyed the hotel very much and can recommend it,2
nice hotel in the centre of nes,2
nice accomodation with a really great breakfast,2
it is really close to the centre of nes and you are within minutes at the beach with the bike,2
the rooms were a lot smaller than expected and the bathroom had mold between some tiles so that s why we rated that part lower,0
amazing wellness facilities at dorint an der messe,2
dorint an der messe cologne is a very nice 4 star hotel,2
the spa and wellness facilities were better than we hoped we would get in a four star hotel compared to some five star hotels we stayed in,2
the pool jacuzzi and sauna were very clean and relaxing,2
the room standard room had all the comfort you need and the breakfast we had was excellent,2
the tables were clean and the staff was friendly and it wasn t over crowded at all,2
if we plan another visit to cologne we would certainly stay at this hotel again,2
very disappointing over priced and rude staff,0
hotel is very over priced considering that you get dated rooms with old and hard linen towels etc poor selection and quality of food at breakfast and many parts of the hotel were closed or under refurbishment rude and unfriendly staff ruined our stay and the hotel boasts about its art collection when it should pay more attention to customer service and standards for guests,0
dana beach resort great,2
what can we say,1
the hotel is very very very very very very very excellent,2
no bad comments at all,1
the italian coffecorner columbus is great also the service of the staff is excellent,2
we will come back for sure,2
good price quality rate with good breakfast,2
good price quality rate,2
breakfast with a lot of choice very nice and helpful people,2
they are rebuilding the hotel,1
location is perfect,2
close to amsterdam and the highway,1
do not recommend the hotel yet because of the rebuilding noise and dirt of the builders,0
great hotel directly on the strip,2
we stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during our trip around the us over summer,1
the hotel was very nice,2
it was held clean and everyone was very friendly,2
the hotel is very big and it takes quite a while to get from one place to the other especially to get to the casino and the shops,1
it also takes quite long to walk through the entire hotel to get to the strip through the main entrance,0
but it is a very nice walk through pretty much the whole hotel,2
as the hotel was only built a few years ago it is not run down at all and is very modern,2
really a nice and modern hotel,2
this is a nice hotel very well located in the town of ness,2
it is modern and the room had a coffee tea machine for your own free coffee or tea,2
this was really appreciated by us,2
the staff was very helpfull and friendly,2
the bathroom was a little small but clean,2
good size tv,2
they serve a really nice breakfast,2
this hotel offers good value for money,2
the only missing thing was a hotel lounge where you can sit and relax or read a paper,1
a very pleasant place,2
this is a very pleasant hotel,2
the neightborhood is nice very central,2
it is few minutes away from everything you might need,1
the rooms are big and very clean,2
the bathroom is n extremely large but yet comfortable and clean,2
internet connection is free and high speed,2
a nice table to work in your room,2
definitively a good place for a business trip or a holiday,2
higly recommended,1
we had an excellent 7 days at the forum beach hotel,2
highlights included great staff nadia and petros are top great food nice apartment cleaned daily and a short taxi ride to the town center amp bars which we thought was great,2
we did daily tour to island of symi scuba diving and some shopping but mainly we just enjoyed the ai and relaxed,2
highly recommended,2
dust,1
the hotel is remarkable for his position in the town 10 minutes by foot to get to the nightlife rembrantplein,2
for the rest it is very dirty for example we found little insects in the room and the sheets were not well cleaned we found stains of i don t want to know what was,0
in addition the bathroom was very little and not you cannot use the sink if the door was closed because there was no space,0
it was not worth of the money we spent for it,0
great family friendly hotel,2
nice hotel with great staff,2
food a bit repeatative,1
not much choice for english,1
lots of eastern european food,1
the russians where happy i will go back to this hotel next year as we had a great holiday,2
quite nice hotel good value for money,2
stayed here for 5 nights in july 2012,1
this hi is what one would expect from hi although check in was quite swift but no upgrade for me as pc platinum member,1
stay was quite noisy as group of school children was staying at the hotel and they were making a lot of noise during the night but reception failed to intervene,0
you might be pleasantly surprised,2
our room was very clean as was the whole hotel,2
food was good always a very good choice in each restaurant,2
there are 5 restaurants and they are all very good,2
food was always hot too,2
neither of us suffered with delly belly,0
staff were friendly and helpful,2
the beach was always busy and had to get there early to get a sunbed,1
i had massages in the health club that is near the gym,1
i would advise to have treatments at the hotel health club as this is better and more professional,2
we did a few diving trips and a trip to mahmya island,1
go for steigenberger frankfurtter hof,1
the steigenberger frankfurtter hof is a great place to stay in frankfurt,2
location is absolutely top going shopping or doing business,2
the service is really top of the line and rooms are renovated in a very classy but modern style,2
i would rank this one among the top five of visits ever,2
a good choice,2
stayed at the ritz carlton south beach due to a conference and the experience was excellent,2
friendly staff great room good breakfast pool and gym,2
a good choice for those who enjoy comfort and luxury,2
wonderful time,2
we were traveling with our friend 4 couples,1
had a very good time nothing to complain except disco music needs to be adjusted when we went to disco there was just our group no more people and we ask dj to play some music from 80 90th and he plays only bob marley and some other music which is imposible to dance,2
we noticed that disco was always empty so change the music or dj,0
liked a lot the dancers but when guests entertain guest with stupid dansing and running around to take shoes and pants from the audience is stupid and borring,0
maybe some people like this,1
rooms food wonderful,2
beaches 3 are small and have rocks we had the water shoes if you come early at the beach don t expect towels until 830 900 am,1
overal resort is good,2
i would go back but bring my own music for disco,2
dorint hotel,1
will defiantly return to this hotel staff where lovely the lobby was welcoming hotel was in great condition and the rooms very comfortable köln city centre is only a short scenic walk from room,2
poor service poor hotel,0
this can not be a 4 stars hotel bad facility and the service is a disaster,0
an old country house locates in the middle of nowhere facilities are old heaters are not warm at night doors can only be locked using keys walls are not sound proof that allow u to hear everything breakfast costs 30 euro per person awful amp with little choices,0
the receptionists are rude and not even close to trying to help after checkouts when i walk out of the hotel this morning the blonde duty manager was literally putting her butt on the reception desk with one foot on the chair and talking bloody loud on her mobile this can not be a 4 star hotel,0
missed a flight in frankfurt,0
it was a great stay and all of my travel stress was gone before i left the breakfast was one of a kind,2
afterwards i relaxed in the pool spa with sauna steam bath and massage and tanning,2
worked out in the gym for an hour with great views of the area and the airport,2
the only downside was too few business centers and one was closed,0
nice hotel in a very good location,2
we have stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend during our trip to bilbao,1
the room was quite tiny and with only one window going into the yard so not much light during the daytime,1
but very silent at night,1
the bed was big and really comfortable and the whole room had everything essential minibar tv and a huge bathroom with a bathtube,2
the rooms were very clean and the staff really friendly,2
one should of course mention the location it is top,1
close to all the interesting points in bilbao and still a little bit off the loud tourist track,2
nice hotel excellent cuisine,2
nice and clean hotel,2
first day when we arrived the toilet wasnt clean,0
second day was toilet cleaned and rest of our stay we had no problem with this,2
breakfast is very good dinner is excellent,2
we stayed six night in this hotel and we were very safisfied,2
we really enjoyed our stay,2
hotel full of russians and children,0
hotel was full of badly behaved children who rushed in front of you almost knocking you over,0
the russian parents had no control over them at any time,0
the food was very basic but edible with good bread soup and desserts,2
room was very clean and large with english speaking room boy who was very polite and helpfull,2
the bar staff looked tired and overworked but did make an effort to smile and make nice comments to you once they knew you were english,2
not suitable for couples without children as evening entertainment was almost nill and geared for families,0
dana beach a bit of heaven on earth,2
my husband and i have been staying at the dana beach for nearly 6 years sometimes on our own and sometimes with our family who also visit alone,1
we have sometimes stayed more than once a year so i m sure that says it all,1
there is absolutely nothing to dislike about the hotel,1
it is spotlessly clean food is excellent and staff are all really friendly,2
it is a shame more british people don t visit but this is not a problem they really don t know what they are missing,0
we will be returning december 14th and staying until january 11th and can t wait,2
we have made so many friends there it is like visiting family,2
nice hotel for short stay close to downtown,2
nice hotel with decent size of rooms,2
small bathroom,1
good service and friendly staff,2
fitness room lacks equipment for basic weight training but offers state of the art cardio equipment,1
overall the hotel can be recomended,1
great hotel although not in the center,2
the eurostars madrid tower is a very modern hotel with tasteful decoration,2
the room was big and luxurious as expected,2
i d recommend you try to get one on the top floors,1
also a word to the restaurant volvereta on the 30th floor great good and amazing views,2
various quality over time up s and down s,1
this is the third time this year that i spend a few days at the hilton for business reason,1
this is the second time i have something not working in my room this time the minibar which was not cooling and even though reception was informed nothing was done,0
i had the same behaviour during my first stay with a shaver plug not working in the bathroom,0
again nothing had been done to correct the problem,0
no paper pencil in room this time no hotel directory neither,1
nevertheless because of its good location aside the liverpool one shopping centre with a lot of bars and restaurant i continue going there when travelling to liverpool,2
can not fault,1
i found this hotel one of the best i have stayed in while travelling in europe for value and service,2
i felt the attention to detail from the staffs attitudes to the room itself was exceptional,2
the worse hotel in miami south beach,0
i booked this hotel for seven days but after two nights i had to change it,1
from the room you can hear every noice,1
a party took place in the room next to mine and lasted until 3am,1
after calling the reception at 2am asking to contact the persons in the room to finish the party nothing happened,1
the bed especially the mattress were unconfortable,0
a magical taste of egypt,1
i will be going again i hope as loved the hotel and relaxed in comfort,2
the titanic palace is one of the most beautiful hotels i have seen and the staff tried their best to help,2
drinks were fine english schhh tonic and food not all to my taste but never went hungry,2
shops cheaper off resort and only a walk awayas long as you are careful and beware of kids pickpocketing etc it is fun to go out and there is a bus from hotel taxis very reasonable and with a little more bar entertainment it would have been a perfect break,2
good choise tasteful meals and clean rooms,2
good and clean hotel,2
the food was good and varieous,2
there were 4 restaurants so you can choose where to dine or lunch,1
rooms were very clean,2
beautifull gardens and swimmingpools,2
even 2 pools were heated,1
lagune with boat to the beach was nice,2
idea hotel milano san siro,1
the hotel is located near the ring road near the football stadium,1
so initially you want to recommend it to football fans and those who drive,1
in general the hotel is modern with a large car park,2
service is normal,1
maid service is good,2
the staff is friendly but once again not work when we arrived we had to ourselves dostovat much luggage and carry in our room,1
breakfast at the hotel buffet no frills,1
ofitsyanty while working well,1
had dinner in the city as in the evening in the hotel bar just worked,1
in general a positive impression of the hotel,2
excellent hotel and staff,2
excellent facilities for adults and chldren,2
range of restaurants and bars,1
superb pool areas and large aqua park area,1
lovely beach area with access for snorkelling and some water sports,2
rooms large and very comfortablelounge areas very large and beautifully decorated,2
spa area excellent with grewat gym facilities,2
indoor games room and bowling alley,1
disappointed,0
we booked this hotel apartment because it had excellent reviews but i was really underwhelmed,0
first we arrived around 9 pm and were charged a steep 20 eur late check in fee which wasn t disclosed on my confirmation e mail and was only fine print on the website i used to book the room,0
this was already a deal breaker because had i known this i would have booked a better hotel for 20 eur more,1
i should also add that it is difficult from there to use public transportation and that we were provided with a set of house rules that seemed made for partying teenagers,0
i d say backpackers only,1
the red square in moscow,1
hurghada is generally speaking a good place for a few days of relax the beach is not so goodthe hotel is nice but if you don t like the worst russians all together that is not the place you want to goavoid the buffet the food is poor the best restaurant is the turkish try to make a reservation,0
animation is great especially the cool riko that at least speaks english otherwise prepare yourself to an intensive russian speaking course,2
the staff is very good with some exceptions,2
one big minus prepare yourself to very persistent shop workers that bother you all the time trying to sell you all kind of things,0
nice hotel in the middle of holland,2
nice star hotel in the middle of holland,2
good start up for excursions and also not far away from utrecht amsterdam and the haque,2
the hotel is a little bid old furnished,1
the central location and the friendly staff is perfect,2
there is no restaurant for lunch or dinner,1
the hotel is working together with diffrent restaurants in the city of woerden,2
breakfast is good,2
there is free wifi in the hotel,2
nice hotel for this price,2
ibis leeds city center,1
the ibis leeds is generally a good hotel for its price,2
i would say its a good 2 star hotel,2
its clean and satisfies all the basic needs the room i got was small but functional it had tv closed and a desk the bed wasn t the most comfortable but was ok,2
the bath room was small but had a cool design,2
other than that the receptionists were very friendly and quick,2
there was not much diversity on breakfast but it was fresh and in good quality,2
the hotel is about a 20 minutes walking distance from the city center and theres nothing around,1
if you re low on budget its the place for you,1
good location average quality,2
the hotel is located next too the exhibition centre on the outskirts in lyon so traveling to the city centre takes some time but the place is well served by public transport,2
actually the tram stop is just outside the hotel,1
the quality of food in the hotel restaurant is excellent with a wide range of things for breakfasts,2
i had some issues with the cleanliness of hotel in general including the rather used rooms which start asking for renovation,0
idem the hotel pool and jacuzzi area,1
it s advantage is location on the hotel top floor so you can admire the view of lyon though,2
second time in this hotel,1
the rooms were clean and big enough with balcony close to the swiming pool but when you close the door to balcony you diidn t hear the noise from outside,1
in two week we change rooms because in first week we were in 5 and in second only 4,1
only in second room nr 475 one bed was in bed conditions we puted blanked under the sheet,1
we have two teenagers who were satisfied again in this hotel ansd in the first week was olso my mum with us sastisfied with food cleaness kindness of staff she doesen t speak foreign languages,2
mixed bag,1
like all hotels in the nl the rooms are tiny kind of hot in the night cuase you can t open the window as most important the rooms on the street side are extremly noisy throughout the night,1
the bath is sort of even tinier,0
matress is really soft but may be ok the whole think has a certain shabby touch and the philosophical statements are not reflected by the staff who works just like in any other hotel bur without any friendly touch,0
nice affordable hotel,2
great price for weekday stay,2
weekends are little costlier,1
but on average it is great,2
pools are awesome,2
nice dining options in the hotel,2
some construction was going on when we were there little annoying but ok,0
hotel never worth five stars,0
if you book a five star resort you at least expect a quite and clean room,1
this is not what is delivered at the encore hotel at wynn las vegas,0
the room we got was covered with dust and a few electrical items like lights and the scale in the bathroom where not working,0
during the night you should not expect to be able to sleep because in the room you will hear the bass and music from the nightclubs the whole night,0
never worth the money we had to pay for the room and the stay,0
i don t recommend this hotel,0
very small room and bathroom,1
extremely unpleasant odor in the bathroom very poor breakfast and almost expired date of the food butter baguette,0
no parking,1
generally to get to the hotel with a car is extremely difficult,0
nice hotel unpleasant stay,2
the hotel is close to everything frankfurt has to offer,2
unfortunately the staff is unable to cope with the standard of a five star hotel my bill was full of errors and i had to discuss about it,0
there is no garage,1
a good choice for a relaxing and lovely weekend,2
this hotel is perfect if you need some relaxing and lovely week end with your partner,2
the spa sauna and jaccuzzi are perfect and it is easily to access from your bedroom thanks to dedicaced lift,2
then you can finish your day around a good meal in restaurant,2
friendy staff and convenient location,2
i am 40 s japanese female,1
i ve stayed at the hotel for 3 times last 12 month,1
every time i come to the hotel all staff welcomes me feels like coming home,2
good location and inexpensive price room is always clean,2
but regrettably the hotel was renovated and covered with constriction things all over the building,0
when i booked the room through hotelscom the site did not say about the renovation,1
moreover when i enquired through email before i came their reply took three days,0
i was concerning whether my booking was confirmed,1
i expect them to reply much quicker for the next time,2
bonne hotel,1
the location is fantastic so close to the louvre and many other sights and also had a balcony good size flat screen tv very comfy bed in room artwork very nice,2
the location was the most appealing aspect of this hotel so close to the louvre and walking distance to most other major tourist sights and also to the train stations,2
conseil attractions the hop on hop off bus is a great way to get around and familiarise yourself with the area maybe two day ticket is the best as it is too much for one day is you want to get off and look at any of the sights,2
mostly favorable,2
the room was clean with minimal interior,2
tv was not working and no phone in the room,0
bathroom was clean however gets flooded when showering with more people in one room very wet,1
staff friendly helpful and professional,2
hotel provided breakfast for free due to tv not working and no telephone in the room,1
unlike the ad on bookingcom breakfast is not free it s 7 person,0
somewhat confusing and unclear,0
transport to the airport too expensive,0
location excellent no elevator and narrow stairs,2
safety with card system and front desk attendance throughout the night excellent,2
fantastic view to the old city,2
the hotel is located in a centre of tallinn just at a very short walking distance from the old city and at a short driving distance from the airport,1
i have absolutely nothing to complain about everything was good,2
two things were especially great,2
the first one was a panoramic view to the old city the dawning that highlighted it by red sunbeams was absolutely fantastic,2
the second one was the buffet breakfast it was very various and it was served since very early morning so i was not deprived of it before my morning flight,2
the price was not cheap fortunately i didn t paid it myself but reasonable and the hotel definitely worths it,2
perfect,2
i would like to thank all staff of the hotel for their good attitude to us and express special thanks to balu and his animation team for their good mood smiles entertaintments i have never laughed so much in my life is in their shous,2
very good,2
a hotel within the hilton standard,1
very comfortable bed and room with sea views,2
ideal location for the forum convention center,1
close to the beach and with a shopping center on the other side of the street,1
thank you for a nice stay,2
thanks a lot for helping us so kindly on the phone and on the reception while we had forgotten our voucher,2
our stay was a real pleasure and we are looking forward to come again we booked already once your hotel and we made a mistake in the booked days and we realised only the day before our leaving at home that the period we taught we had booked had already passed by so we were very glad that this time every thing was getting out well,2
small cheap hotel,1
it is a very small hotel in 5 km from orly airport,1
i couldn t find anything interesting around it,0
room was very small and poor,0
window of the room was to the roadside and very many cars pass by this road,1
ideally situated in the heart of florence,1
the hotel staff were warm and welcoming and were always helpful with directions,2
the breakfast was adequate not many varieties of bread and good coffee,2
the only glitch no eggs scrambled or otherwise because of delivery issues during weekends,0
a 4 star hotel should have some items of hot breakfast,1
the attending staff were nice and friendly in the breakfast room,2
i found the hotel clean and well maintained the ac worked perfectly,2
the guests seemed to be mainly italian british and american,1
the hotel provides for little but important things like razor with gel bus tickets,2
internet centre was great,2
try this hotel only if you haven t other choises,1
we must pay at check in,1
room very small moquette with stains spiderweb on the walls,1
unconfortable beds little pillows short sheets with holes,0
last day we finished toilet paper we haven t found a new roll,1
the drain of our shower needed to be unclog,1
no phone no breakfast old cathode tv free wi fi with low signal in the upper floors,1
staff gentle enough but the guy at the reception with white hair and glasses we found him in the night and the early morning extremely rude and hysterical,0
nice winter city trip in köln,2
we enjoyed a very nice weekend break in the köln dorint,2
thanks to the special weekend rates during january we decided to make this extra winter city trip,1
köln is really worth visiting and the dorint a very comfortable place to stay,2
it only was a pity that the underground parking did cost us exact 50 of the room rate,0
but the rooms were indeed very comfortable and the food excellent,2
club dolphin,1
clean but not updated is same as it was 9years ago not to many rooms just enough to make it not too crowded we were full board breakfast was good rest of meals not enough choice,2
central location,1
good location 2 minutes from duomo but very loud location not possible to have a quite night sleep at all,0
very small rooms old furnished,1
frankly only to recommend for young students who do not need sleep in the night and need a good location for little money,1
not a comfortable hotel at all,0
the rooms are not worth its price even for 50 euro a night,0
breakfast is no go but there are enough good locations everywhere to have a good coffee and snack in the morning,2
upper rooms were very small without own bathrooms and wc,1
so it is not really a hotel but low budget room accommodation,1
i wil not recommend anyone to stay there,0
sorry,0
excellent 5 star hotel,2
5 star hotel with easy access and good location to frankfurt airport,2
good shuttle bus service to and from hotel to frankfurt airport,2
gym and swimming pool are where i can work out my body after a long and tedious travel in the city,2
friendly helpful hosts,2
our hosts were friendly and very helpful,2
everything was wonderfully clean and the en suite bathroom was ingeniously placed,2
a wonderful range of food for breakfast and we were offered scrambled egg on toast after 3 weeks in france on bread and jam this was a feast to behold,2
on sunday morning we saw the ladies going to church in traditional dress which was wonderful to see,2
best hotel in hurghada,2
first class service in every department from cleaners to waiters and service desk at reception booked a double room with wife and grandaughter and was given a free upgrade to a junior suite what more can i say excellent food and drinks plenty sunbeds at pools and beach,2
my favourite hotel in cologne,2
excellent value for money good breakfast and excellent wellness facilities,2
though not in the centre the public transport system stops right in front of the hotel and brings u in a minimum of time to the centre thus avoiding parking problems and the like,1
have been a frequent visitor to this hotel since 2000,1
budget stay in paris,1
i suppose you get what you pay for,1
the breakfast was decent enough,2
the accommodation itself left something to be desired the room was rather small the twin bed took up 2 3rds of the space the bathroom was very small with gaps in the wall and exposed pipes that were rather noisy,0
there was a certain amount of dust on the floor,1
the location itself was rather good with a number of decent shops and restaurants that i made use of,2
wonderful facility but,2
hotel was great with a superb staff room and restaurants,2
we chose the hotel for relaxation before our journey home,1
the sky spa was a disappointment not due to facility,0
the sauna steam room area was constantly invaded by families and singles in swim wear including children with goggle and floaties with no spa etiquette,0
the staff did an excellent job of keeping unaccompanied children out of pool and work out area,2
however the sauna steam room area was not managed as well,0
i suggest the staff tell quests proper etiquette and dress for use of those facilities as well as additional signage so guests like us can enjoy the excellent facilities,2
poor with very bad acoustic,0
we have passed 2 nights at the hotel and it s main advantage is the very central location just near the great wheel and the bridge,2
a táxi to victoria station is about 12 pounds and it s very close to waterloo 5 minutes walk to big bem,1
the major dissapointment was the room itself very very little bathroom with poor amenities and worse of all you could hear everything from the rooms around,0
literally it seemed as the neighbours were inside of our room,1
i remeber we booked the hotel mainly because of it s central location and the price but definately wouldn t repeat my stay in there,0
great all inclusive trip,2
my family went to jamaica on a last minute trip,1
the grand palladium lady hamilton resort was recommended to us,2
the resort is absolutely beautiful,2
the food is great especially bubba s steakhouse ate there twice,2
the service was excellent,2
the pool bartenders were extremely pleasant and always attentive of our needs,2
they knew what we wanted to drink as we approached the bar,1
it was an excellent time had by all and i would highly recommend this resort to my family and friends,2
an excellent place to stay with friendly hosts,2
alphons amp martha are excellent hosts most accommodating amp helpful finding our way and with use of their facilities over and above expectations without being intrusive,2
breakfast was super,2
this would be our first recommendation for a quiet stay close to the city,2
gerrit amp connie,1
bc canada,1
4 star hotel amenities but 2 star service,1
hotel ambience is good,2
breakfast is above average,0
bar is very good,2
gym is small but sufficient for standard workouts,1
nice wellness and breakfast staffs,2
polite and professional,2
never tried the spa and swimming pool though,1
free wireless internet connections available in rooms and lobby which made this hotel attractive,2
also have several deskstop computers for guest use,1
stayed for 2 months but don t know who is in charge of the hotel,1
you would nt know who is the manager or supervisor unless you ask,1
everyone looks the same and name badges gives no clue,0
as its located near the schiphol airport at times may get surge of guests whose flights are cancelled,1
lots of groups passing in the weekends,1
trendy hotel in a nice spot,2
the hotel is located on a good spot public transport all around,2
a great shopping mall just around the corner,2
some nice good rated restaurants outside the hotel as well,2
the hotel is lovely furnished,2
breakfast is basic however tasteful,1
bar staff is friendly probably students,2
the reception staff is not very well english educated,0
if you speak some words spanish it s makes it all a bit easier,2
we had 3 complaints,0
1 one was solved perfectly the other 2 below expectation,1
overall we had a nice stay on a nice place,2
personally i prefer one of the other nn hotels,1
beach cricket,1
we had a very enjoyable stay at the hotel,2
we were with a small group who came to watch the test match in colombo,1
the drive to the ground was a lengthy 2 hours each morning as the roads are very gridlocked,0
the hotel and staff were very welcoming,2
the food was international hotel food buffet style and was excellent,2
i would recommend this for someone wanting a relaxing time,2
very welcoming,2
the hotel has ample parking and a great lobby,2
the rooms were clean and comfortable the staff very attentive,2
although we stayed at a very busy time the last few days of octoberfest the staff paid attention to detail and we felt very welcome,2
make sure to go downstairs for a nice breakfast the buffet had a fantastic healthy selection,2
make sure to unload your luggage at the entrance as there is a set of stairs from the parking lot,1
a huge disappointment,0
this hotel is not worth 3 stars at all,0
the rooms are tiny the furniture carpets and walls need an urgent refurbishment and some cleaning would be nice,1
there was a strange smell in all of our three rooms,1
one tv didn t function several times,0
there were nousy works going on starting at 9 a m,1
good morning paris,2
the good sides are limited to two the location is excellent and the breakfast was ok,2
swiming swans in the pond and park view from lobby,1
a pleasant location where you can just walk around the pond and be cared for in a very hospitable way in the hotel,2
the food and variety is great with a friendly staff,2
well worth the money and time spent,2
rooms is good but the restaurants specially the main restaurant the menus ls everytime same child pool is to cold a la carte restaurants ls very good maxxiland is really good for the child and for us,2
the best hotel in hurghada,2
i found the titanic beach and spa a fantastic hotel to stay in i stayed for a month in march 2012 also a month in november 2012 and again a month in february 2013 the staff were fantastic,2
we are both disabled pensioners and my wife has a wheelchair nothing was too much trouble for them,1
i would specially like to thank ahmed in reception and wojeck in administrationfor all there help during our stay,2
a wonderful stay,2
martha and alphons are fantastic hosts,2
they are very friendly and knowledgeable about spakenburg and the surrounding area,2
the rooms were neat very clean wonderfully decorated and comfortable,2
the breakfast was delicious and everything was offered cheese fruit breads juice coffee tea and chocolate sprinkles my personal favourite,2
the location is in a nice safe quiet street close to a supermarket and the bus stop,2
good quality bikes were available to hire to get you into the town centre quickly,2
i will definitely be returning on my next trip to holland,2
very good and nice hotel,2
very friendly personal,2
we are surely coming back to this very good hotel,2
everything was great,2
very very good,2
food and drinks were great,2
there was nothing that we did not like at this hotel,0
swimmingpools enough,1
i am very upset about this hotel,0
the room i was staying in was very old fashioned,1
when you come in the door on the left hand side there is a old cabinet and old commode with an very old tube television,1
i am no technical novice but i tried 5 minutes hard to get this tv working i even was thinking about calling the room service to ask about the tv,0
after the tv worked i settled down on my bed but what was the first thing to see,1
you guessed right a big dirty spot on sheet,0
after staying 10 minutes in the room i was already really angry,0
dirty public restrooms,0
friendly staff,2
surprising good stay,2
i stayed in a redecorated and refurnished room,1
that was a surprise,2
had a very good stay for two nights,2
restaurant was ok although that atmosphere did not match the new room,0
but maybe the next stay that area will be done as well,1
be sure to ask for a new room,1
too expensive for ordinary service,0
the only advantage of this hotel is location,2
it is located 7 minutes away by foot from amsterdam cetral train terminal,1
the price is too expensive for such ordinary service,0
the room is too small the bathroom is not clean moreover there was a problem with bathroom equipment after the shower always water on the floor,0
the food was very usual fast food on breakfast,1
the booking conditions were free cancelation but they charged me full amount with no explanation,0
i have spend 1 month to get my money back,1
it was employee s fault,0
anyway think before making booking of this hotel,1
holidays at the titanic beach hotel may 2013,1
we stayed at titanic beach for one week on may 2013,1
overall impression of the hotel is excellent very nice suroundings great distance to the sea friendly staff,2
one thing that could have been better is the food could be more of variety or a choice of local foods,1
the service that needs quite a big improvement is the gold s spa,1
the massage itself was good but other ingredients of a spa treatment was not impressive the staff talking to each other all the time in their language during all the treatment and that doesn t help to relax,0
but despite that we would definately recommend this hotel for holidays and we had a very good time there,2
amazing hotel,2
hotel is very beaituful,0
there is a lot of bars and a la carte restaurantswe could easily make reservation for a la carte restaurants and we mostly liked to have a dinner in ottoman restaurant,2
nice hotel with good wellness facilities,2
very nice hotel with good wellness facilities the hotel is just a 15min walk from the city center,2
don t want to walk,0
the tram stops just in front of the hotel,1
if you come by car there is a car park underneath the hotel,1
excellent,2
really excelent hotel clean and beautiful room comprehensive choice of delicious food and drinks in different restaurant beach near the hotel very nice people animators waiters cooks receptionist cleaning men great animations program step aerobic oriental dance and specially water gym and at night disco,2
i of course recommend dana beach,2
beautiful and quiet,2
this is a beautiful hotel in lovely grounds in a quiet location a couple of miles outside the city of york to which it is very well connected by park and ride bus service,2
the atmosphere is delightfully tranquil and relaxing and it was for us a lovely place to return to after a busy day sightseeing in the city,2
the rooms are spacious and well furnished,2
our only criticism would be the bathroom which is a little small and in need of updating and refreshing,0
that said it is adequate and immaculately clean,2
room service is excellent too,2
likewise the restaurant is excellent,2
we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would happily return when we visit york again,2
8th stay,1
big hotel area for nearby 300 guests,1
cleanless is very good in all the zones,2
all iclusive serice,1
european people mostly english and german speaking only few russian and polish middle age,1
many nice changes since my last stay,2
it was my second stay at this wonderful hotel and it was just great,2
in the few months a lot has been completed and beautified,2
the beautifully landscaped grounds the new children s playground just about everything last year was not yet finished,2
it has been created from a very pleasant grounds a wonderful facility,2
what is also noticed very positive there were not many russians in this hotel,2
during my time 60 german dutch and italians of the rest,1
unfortunately i can only give the maximum number of 6 points this hotel has earned it in some areas but the score 8,0
great value for money,2
it was a great experience for my family to stay in the hotelthe staff was very friendly and helpfulathe amenities which the hotel offers are good value for moneyi strongly recommend this hotel and in a future if i visit bulgaria i will choose it as my hotel again,2
unacceptable,0
upon suggestion of hotel manager during our previous visit last october we booked directly not through agency to obtain a better price for a 5 day stay and we anticipated half of the cost,1
unfortunately one of us had a serious accident with a 10 day stay at hospital one week before travel to hasselt so we had to cancel our trip,0
upon contacting the hotel one week before trip to cancel reservation we discovered that no refund will be possible while no advice was provided during reservation about cancelling policies,0
we are very very unhappy about this treatment in such serious situation and after staying there a lot of times,0
so in the future no more trips to this hotel will be booked from our association and we suggest all other people to be very careful,1
the biggest room in golden sands and i think biggest hotel bathroom in bulgaria,2
quiet friendly big beds free internet nice pool of course i will recommend this hotel to all my friends,2
good cheap bussiness choice,2
this is a very good quite cheap hotel next to trafford shopping center,2
it is quiet place where you can sleep well and internet is working very fast and reliable but as well thanks to the huge mall you will have chance to buy just couple of steps outside the hotel almost everything as well as taste cusines from all over the world,2
in the hotel itself you will find nice restaurant and very good food,2
sausages and mashrooms which are served in the morning are very good,2
receptionists are very helpful and are helping in any request of support,2
terrible stay,0
hotel really modern and minimal,2
check in quite slow even if the welcome cocktail was good,2
room modern and nice but from the toilet comes out sewer smell terrible,0
nice pool in the roof top but the towels have to be collected only in the ground floor really uncomfortable,0
lack of private space with sun beds on the front beach it s necessary for a 4 or 5 star hotel with front beach,1
don t you think,1
spa services too expensive,0
not so many restaurants around,1
too pollution in the surrounding streets,0
beachwalk centre for shopping is far 10min for the hotel,1
honestly speaking don t try kuta or legin area too crowded and polluted,0
go to sanur or jimbaran really better,1
good rest with my mother and my dog,2
the atmosphere in this hotel is professional and warm at the same time,2
there is a forest directly next to the hotel for doggy walks,1
the reception was most helpful in every way,2
the hotel was clean and well organized,2
parking is of course no problem and the shuttle service is so fantastic i left my car in the hotel parking to take my mother to the airport,2
the beds were als not too hard and not too soft perfect,2
i had a bit of trouble adjusting the heating but help was quick,1
the showers are a dream,1
i can recommend this hotel to anyone,2
by the way i have stayed here for the third time and will do so more,2
my mother is btw 86 years old,1
thank you steigenberger team,2
great place for business and pleasure,2
it was my first visit at the hotel and i have to say that i am very pleased with my experience,2
the service was excellent from the very beginning and the organization of the conference i attended was outstanding,2
the conference room was spacious and bright timing was perfect all the staff knowledgeable and professional,2
being located on the beach and the comfort of the room made my stay that much more enjoyable and the transition from business to pleasure very easy,2
after hours of meetings being able to escape into the beauty of golden sands in a matter of minutes was something i really appreciated,2
i would highly recommend the hotel to all my friends and colleagues visiting the area,2
overall it was a great experience one i would gladly repeat,2
wishing you a very prosperous new year,2
steigenberger airport hotel,1
staying here about 2 3 times a year mostly business,1
this time stay was private with entire family incl child and infant 3 rooms,1
all our requests were perfectly handled by saff,2
staff is very capable beds are super comfortable breakfast buffett is awesome airport shuttle service the moct convenient i have ever had,2
two stays,1
stayed at the itc twice once in a single room during the celebrations for queens dayfor five nights and was very dissapointed with the singke room was assured that the double room was better so myself and my partner stayed for five nights later in the same month and found the room to be clean comfortable and adequate for what we wanted we did not have the breakfast at the hotel and found this to be the right choice due to the availability of better food locally,2
value for money,1
food was excellent i only missed good coffee i enjoyed especially home made pastry and cakes,2
also fitness choice of food every evening was very good,2
the swimming pool for families with children and another one for a relax,1
the bikes which we could take for a short trip were in very bad conditions,0
i can recommend this hotel,2
budget hotel at the terminale centrale milan,1
this hotel is located a couple of blocks from the central railway station in milan italy called terminal centrale,1
this budget hotel is in a generally ok condition the room and the bathroom were in a good shape,2
given the fact that it is located at a major intersection the noise level was higher than usual,1
the only bad thing was that the restaurant area and the breakfast was really poor quality and they even charged us despite the fact that we had that covered in the reservations,0
after complaining at the check out it was obvious that the receptionist will not confirm what the check in receptionist already did that our reservation covers the breakfast as well,0
a design hotel in an edgy area of paris,1
this was one of the most interesting hotels i ve stayed ever in a district of paris not commonly on the tourist map but still just a short walk away from montmartre and gare du nord for eurostar and other high speed rail connections and airport rer line b this hotel was a great discovery for us,2
the rooms are fabulous with simplistic design and there are no keys rather fingerprints let you through to you room,2
the bar is great food is brilliant and there is a small gym in the basement for a morning work out,2
breakfast is highly recommended also as are drinks in the rather pricy bar,2
great hospitality,2
we had an excellent vacation nothing but credit,2
the staff was really great and the service was superb,2
a lot of food with good local products a nice place to relax a paradise,2
we enjoyed the all in as well and can be recommended,2
rent a car cycling as well or to visit the mountain village of agia marinachania and especially this hotel have stolen our hearts,0
we are looking forward to hear calimera everywhere again and to enjoy the really great hospitality of these people,2
its a good hotel with nice rooms,2
we hade a bigger room with a place to relax and sit down,2
we really liked that,2
service was good and friendly the room was cleaned every day,2
the only thing we could eat at the hotel was breakfast which in my opinion was a little bit expensive,0
crowded noisy smelly unfriendly,0
this place is just awful,0
marseillan plage is a really dirty place,0
don t go here if you want a quiet relaxing holiday,1
the bar at the campsite plays very loud music every night till midnight,1
then you get all the wasted yobs going back to their tents for an all night party,0
wish i d brought a set of ear plugs,1
our pitch smelt of sewage so didn t do any cooking,0
our neighbours were a group of racist french chavs who made it clear to us we weren t welcome,0
the beaches and swimming pools were totally jammed,0
we complained to the campsite but they were unfriendly and weren t interested,0
we left after 2 days wish we d gone sooner,1
avoid,1
melia is the best hotel in bulgaria,2
this is oyr 10th time in bulgaria but for sure the best one,2
melia is the best hotel,2
the biggest room in bulgaria with lovely sea view,2
already booked our next visit in 2013,1
we recommend it to everybody,2
the staff was very friendly the beach is 2 minutes walking and the sea is great,2
the food was good as well though the waiters were a bit tired,2
everybody speaks russian and it is very easy to get informed if you need something,2
thank you melia,2
will come back for sure,2
great location but no,1
i would not go back,1
i stayed there for a business trips with several other colleagues,1
i had a studio room with a kitchen well the kichen was old gross and kind in a cupboard,1
not a lot of space in the room a general issue in paris anyway and an old bathroom,0
breakfast is brought to the room quality is very poor better of going out to grab a croissant,0
service is not reliable several mistakes made in the orders happened to me and some colleagues tea instead of coffee no show getting 2 breakfasts instead of 1,0
definetely to be avoided except if you want to be near the arc de trimphe and champs elysees but there are better options around,1
excellent location everthing at walking distance,2
excellent location for this stylish hotel,2
deira city center shoping mall is across the street and a metro station is just outside the entrance of hotel,1
everything you need is there at walking distance,2
very good kitchen and nice pub,2
the swimming pool is quite small so don t look forward a resort type structure,0
it is more a city hotel with all the comforts,2
very attentive and courtesious staff but i would suggest the management a more careful selection of suppliers of desert trips,1
i have done dozens of those always very fulllfilling but this one was a bad experience,0
not at meridien s level,0
save that i definitely recommend the hotel,2
city break in las vegas,1
we stayed at the hotel just for one night during our sightseeing trip to usa,1
we were very satisfied with the hotel,2
the price was amazing the service perfect,2
the hotel provides free shuttle taxi to different places on the strip rooms are quite spacious and modern,2
complimentary breakfast served in the lobby was good,2
absolutely amazing for the price we paid,2
good hotel no complaints,2
as a young couple the hotel gave us what we expected,1
clean room helpful staff a nice balcony with sea view,2
directly next to the hotel a really good pizzeria,2
unfortutanely the beach is 95 private and no sandbeach which of course is not the hotels fault,1
all comfort resort,1
a very nice resort with 100 comfort,2
clean nice friendly polite people,2
all the services were great,2
after a long day trip to luxor we still could have a dinner because it s possible until 2400,2
the next day we used the late breakfast,1
superb,2
big variety of nationality and age,1
beautiful surroundings nice beach friendly staff,2
unfortunately i do not so much speak english to comment and to review the hotel without errors,0
overall i liked the rest,2
one note i would like a more fun evening at the hotel,2
i would also like to in the rooms was free water,2
good,2
brilliant holiday except from the food the food was diabolical,0
apart from the food my holiday was brilliant all because of alanani rocko axaha and the sandman wagdy helal,2
i couldn t go back 2 this hotel because i had hardly eaten all holiday,0
alanani rocko and axaha should be working in a five star hotel because they were brilliant,2
great holiday with an awesome animation team,2
it s a great holiday resort to go to i recommend it to anybody,2
gemma and aimee in the animation team really took care of us whilst we were there and it was a really good help the rest of the animation team were also great food was lovely could of had abit more variety on some days but was very nice food,2
nothing to complain about with the hotel or the room or pool etc was a lovely get away with some great people and some really friendly and helpful staff in the animation team,2
the hotel staff were also great,2
sun relax for families,2
what made the difference for us was the miniclub the two girls tanja and emmy are really good we were with our daughter not yet 4 but she was always looking forward to hear the girl calling miiiini cluuub,2
she had fun and we had our deserved rest,2
the girls organized even our daughter birthday party very nice,2
all the evenings after dinner mini mini minidisco ya ya ho half an hour of crazy dancing and the kids were ready to sleep,1
the food is really good and available all day long i m a picky italian as well as the drinks there is a good espresso at the columbus bar,2
looks definitely don t mean anything,0
the reception area looks very good and almost newly decorated,2
the outside looks dated but in a good enough state,2
this doesn t describe the state of the rooms themselves though,0
the hotel offers wireless internet for an additional 15 euros for 24 hours which is okay but in my opinion should be free nowadays,2
the other guests that i have seen were labourers probably from one of our eastern european countries and working in paris in addition i have to say that i also have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels where people look fine but from personality are far worse,0
looks definitely don t mean anything,0
hip elegance in louise area of brussels,1
the hotel is clean modern and hip,2
dark loungy feel in the lobby hushed and modern in the halls and rooms,1
appears that the hotel was recently renovated and done so with style and attention to detail,2
my basic room had robe and slippers nespresso machine and free minibar drinks,2
staff were friendly,2
free gym was ample and spa available though i didn t use it,1
the location is excellent situated at the end of avenue louise with lots of fancy shops and restaurants are close by,2
also not far from the sablon and downtown so overall very well located,2
i would certainly stay here again,2
airport shuttle is not complimentary,0
to the hotel from the hotel the shuttle bus is gratis,1
but from the hotel to the airport there are some strict rules at this hotel,1
1,1
pre booking is a must,1
2,1
but the ticket at the hotel bus driver does not sell the ticket,0
3,1
no information provided for the above at the reception unless you ask for that,1
many people are pull out of the shuttle bus because of this,1
a basic experience,1
i arrived late at night,1
the receptionist was friendly and took all the trouble to help me,2
i didn t go to the bar but went directly to my bed and slept till 730 am next morning,1
hte bathing facilities were good,2
my breakfast was more than sufficient,2
i checked out,1
again an very vriendly receptionist,0
thers is nothing more i can tell you,1
i didn t see much of the hotel or the facilities,0
i only went to bede there,1
review koeln dorint an der messe,1
we had an affordable upgrade to a maisonette,2
great choice,2
quiet large feeling of luxury,2
nice sauna area,2
staff at reception and breakfast was excellent helpful friendly and polite,2
we will certainly come back next year when we have another event at lanxess arena,2
nice hotel,2
spacious room and modern style not old like in other polish hotel,2
staff well prepared and kind,2
good quality breakfast,2
wi fi free and good conncetion,2
we tried the restaurant good quality food but service really really slow despite not so many people to serve,0
spoiled the impression of the trip,1
terrible hotel,0
тhis is not a four star hotel,1
rooms do not correspond to the pictures very old furniture faded linens creaky bed a disgusting smell in the room even though we asked for when booking a non smoking room,0
after the check out we left our bag in the luggage at the front desk,1
after we returned the desk clerk said that they gave our luggage to others,1
we had to go to the police and to write a statement,1
in the end we went home without our things,1
after 33 days,1
our departure the hotel sent us our bag but there s no a few personal belongings worth about 200 euros,1
dana beach resort,1
second time staying at dana beach resort there same time last year,1
resort rooms clean and tidy,1
excellent selection of food choice of restaurants and bars,2
staff cannot do enough for you,1
frankfurt s finest,1
the frankfurter hof is surrounded by some of europe s most impressive skyscrapers,2
the building itself is only a few stories tall but still it manages to impress with it s classical palace like architecture,2
the main entrance is a small letdown,0
one would expect to enter the building through the front gate,1
instead the entrance is a small door on the side of the building,1
once inside the elegance and atmosphere of the lobby will quickly remind you why you chose this hotel,2
dog friendly,2
we was there with two dogs fine areas to take the dogs out for walk and dogs very welcome even in the restaurant,2
short drive to amsterdam rai,1
quietly place and god parking areas,1
staff very helpful,2
i would like to go byack write now,1
nice hotel in big territory not on big builnding but smaller houses from the reception building till the seaside,2
the best all inclusive service i have ever experienced in egypt,2
very clean everywhere,2
mainly german guests,1
great place friendly and efficient staff,2
stayed for a weekend good location between village and beach accepts dogs a must for us great staff very helpful,2
the car park gets a little busy when there is a function on but all worked out with a bit of cooperation the breakfast times are fine during the week but i would have preferred a little later cut off on sunday again the staff sorted it to everýone s satisfaction,2
we had a groundfloor room so access for my scootmobile was no problem and parking of the scootmobile was also sorted without any fuss a great team staff and management,2
ok hostel,1
we decided to go to barcelona just on the spoor of the moment bought plane tickets just one week before,1
there were no many hostels still available,1
the hotel is new and nicely designed however it doesn t have such a hostel atmosphere,2
the common area is very small,1
the room we stayed in was unbelievable small,1
it was a 6 person dorm but i think it was originally designed to be a 4 person one,1
wasn t that easy to move around,0
breakfasts aren t included in the price however there is a supermarket just next door so you can grab something to eat there,1
a nice hotel good food,2
animation team super only old equipment,1
nice shows and enterainment,2
good food nice people,2
swimmingpool super good area and chears,2
drinks super nice coktails,2
busses to the beache and drinks at al time,1
good location but some services can be better,2
my room was very clean and the air condition worked well,2
i had a double room for single occupation so enough area for one person at least,1
at that novotel was not offering wifi for free except in the lobby area so i had to go there for using the interenet which was evry slow in november 2011,0
that might have changed now,1
i was very disapointed by the breakfast services as i asked for a double expresso instead of the normal filter coffe they wanted to charge me for that,0
fine classic hotel but service needs to be improved,1
first time with a vip group in this hotel i had high expectations about this heritage style hotel,2
the hotel itself is fine but the staff and service level was below standard,0
it started that we had to argue to enter with the coach the parking area in front in order to off load luggage,1
handing out the keys was slow motion and ineffecient at breakfast guests had to ask twice for coffee tea used plates remained too long on the tables,1
questions by my group members were answered politely but not being of help and not offering a solution,0
on the other side the hotel building is full of character and charme,2
weihnacht markt weekend,1
i was there wiht my wife and brother and his wife we stay there for 1 night,1
and it was great and nice good people in the hotel and very friendly and helpfull,2
and the weihnacht markt was very nice like always,2
very good hotel,2
such a lovely hotel everything was excellent,2
the hotel rooms were excellent and the bathrooms were large very clean the food had such a variety,2
i am british and i went with my friends 4 and the ages ranged from 35 to 65,1
fantastic and luxury place,2
i was second time in egypt,1
sunrise mamlouk is very lovely hotel with interesting architecture an beautiful gardens the atmosphere was amazing comfortable room the food very tasty and relaxing music in the restaurant,2
the waiters from lobby bar mina weal and milad restaurant bar were realy reliable helpful and litle bit serious,2
very important was for me active rest during holidaymy expectations about that meet team of animators especially aldo and negga and girls of aerobicthey are proffesional creative and always smiling young peoplethe animation team are have positive attitude to life and doing good job in hotel,2
thanks to you we came back tp poland satisfied and relaxed,2
overnight stay in amsterdam,1
just what we were looking for,1
the hotel had free parking and was near a subway station that brought you straight to the city center,2
so no worries about were to park,1
clean and renewed room you could still smell the new in the hall,2
the perfect resort for the perfect holiday,2
it was a perfect choice for wonderful holidays,2
the service was marvellous,2
the staff s foreign languages and general competences were excellent,2
the hotel offered great leisure activities,2
the best animations which i ve ever seen especially water gym with sasha and kuku,2

i ll come back here next year,1
hotel is placed about 30 minutes from center of paris metro line 12,1
area around is awful,0
lot of homeless,0
we was afraid about our safe,0
metro is located about 5 7 minutes from hotel,1
near by hotel is lot of trash throw all over the place we saw also death rat at the street,0
room was not hoovered even 1 tine during 5 days so it shouldn t happened,0

all was good and i would come again to visit,2
everything was alright by the way i would come again if i travel to egypt the hotel manager is very friendly and helpfull also the service of the staff good work,2
friendly greetz,2
come only when you are a family with lots of kids,1
this was a weird stay,0
tho hotel it s self was okay,2
there were just alot of people,1
seemed like the staff couldn t handle the amount of people,0
the food was delicious one you got to it,2
the pool area is crowded as hell,0
no room there,1
very loud music,1
the beach was very nice,2
water was very clean,2
room cleaning was terrible,0
complaints handling took hours,0
only go when you like alot of people,1
our best holiday to date,2
we spent 5days touring sri lanka and 7 days at the club hotel dolphin in what can only be described as our best holiday to dat,2
my husaband and i travelled with our 2 adult children and their partner and the holiday was all we could have hoped for with beautiful surroundings attentive but not intrusive staff and excellent food,2
the rooms were excellent and the standard of cleanliness impeccable,2
the kids room were on the beach although ours was set further back and a little hemmed in but as we weren t in the room for long it wasn t a problem,1
we were evacuated due to a tsunami warning during our stay and the staff dealt with the situation calmly and professionally at all times we were kept informed and supplied with food and drink until we were able to return to the hotel,1
a wonderful holiday,2
good 4 stars hotel,2
the empire palace is a good 4 stars hotel,2
good staff comfortable bed and great breakfast,2
both room and bathroom were a bit small though,1
it s within walking distance of rome s most important sights,2
great hotel,2
the hotel gilde in deventer nl on niuewstraat is the best hotel i have ever been in,2
i travel the world and have never seen such a friendly and professional staff,2
every need is attended to very quickly and happily,2
the food is good,2
the rooms are nice and every part of the hotel bright and clean the gardens and hotel are beautiful,2
the hotel manager michel stays on top of everything leads by example and has a well trained staff,2
i have been treated like family since i have been staying here 2 months,2
there is no other hotel in deventer for me but the gilde,1
i would recommend this hotel to everyone business travellers and families,2
hotel tornese ever,1
i am a customer of this hotel for over 10 years but i have never experienced such a miserable service this year,0
for years we enmenons friends and family with us but this is the last time,1
the hotel tornese lost regular customers,0
value for money in derby,1
i stayed at the attic room which is the cheapest available in rangemoor park hotel,1
it is a very small room that is not very pretty but the sheets were clean and the bed comfy,2
there is a washbasin in the room and also a kettle with tea and coffee provided and replenished during service,1
shared shower and toilets are down the very steep stairs and also clean,2
full english breakfast is served on sundays it was nothing extraordinary but for the price alright,2
on mondays breakfast is served in another hotel just across the street very basic continental with cereals bread one type of ham and cheese juices hot drinks etc,1
overall it s absolutely alright for the price you pay and the breakfast while nothing special is a nice plus,2
amazing holiday,2
the hotel was massive and had everything that i could possibly need,2
amazing value for money and excellent location,2
the staff were amazing they made the whole holiday and even to the point where we extended our stay,2
loved the amination staff especially eran is a true friend for life,2
the best hotel we know,2

the standard is in top we love the cleanliness very good every restaurant is in the top clean and very good food,2
thoroughly enjoyable holiday,2
from arriving at the hotel the staff couldn t do enough for us,0
the bungalow was excellent the pool guys always helped and were very pleasant,2
the waiters were friendly pleasant and helpful,2
the a la carte restaurant and the fish restaurant were excellent and good value,2
we have travelled all over the world and rate this as one of the best holidays,2
my husband became disabled in recent years and the help we received from the staff made it a holiday we could relax and enjoy without any stress to myself,2
the only down side was the dress code in the restaurants as in a hotel of this quality we would expect an evening dress code eg long trousers for men and no beach wear,0
hotel golden 5 city topaz club,1
i was there with a college 15 days ad iwe like topaz club much more than golden five,2
the double rooms are perfect and very clean,2
the personal in the whole hotel let you feel that you are welcome en they treat you with care,2
the boys in the lobby bar fimo but also all the others were very friendly,2
my personel favourite is gaber in the main restaurant as well as in the italian rest,2
but as i said all the personal was very okay,2
one of the staff members speaks very good dutch en hussein m the duty manager gave us a warm welcome and a very pleasant stay,2
thank you all for that,2
the only thing we missed was snorkeling and a reef and a dutch channel on television,1
miss you all,1
a little piece of heaven,2
a nice hotel in a good place,2
at 2 steps from downtown,1
breakfast is wonderful,2
vital spa is nice but interesting because accessible from 7 am to 11 pm,2
koln contains a lot of shopping and church,1
good budget location for budget travelers,2
the location is excellent within walking distance to tivoli and the city center in general plus being such a huge building you could easily spot it from a distance and never get lost,2
the bar on the ground floor is opened till late and serves cheap carlsberg,1
maybe the staff is not as friendly as one can expect but they have to deal with hundreds of guest maybe one thousand in busy weekend night so they may be excused,1
overall this is a good budget accommodation i booked one bed in a dorm for one weekend for people on a budget,2
i will be back in my next stay at copenhagen,1
excecutive chef and his team excellent great food,2
our vacation was made by the executive chef and his team very friendly cooks and helpful always ready to go beyond expectation the wait staff in the restaurant can learn a lot from the cooks fantastic food all over the hotel in the main restaurant and in the bistro the executive chef was always there to answer your queries the sous chef was always checking the food to be hot and fresh the restaurant managers were dull so was the staff the food and beverage manager never had a smile on his face neither greeted the guests poor performance we will visit the hotel again just because of the great food and the smiling cooks behind the pasta lines,2
dive instructor just the best,2

in our 14 days stay in all inclusive vas greatincredible size of the suite clean and very luxuryfood is good nice coktailsstaff is wery friendly especialy animation team and manager mohamed he ensures that everything you need is therethank you allwe enjoyed it,2
a great location,2
we stayed in a beach villa overlooking the sea number 50 it was in a beautiful position was very clean and well furbished,2
the area in front of our villa was used for the several marriage ceremonies we witnessed from our porch during our stay,1
the grounds around our villa were maintained to a very high standard as was the reception area and also the dining area,2
our villa was positioned towards the quiet pool area of the complex and i feel i can only comment on this area as we did not visit the large pool where the animators conducted games of various kinds,1
we are in our sixties and wanted a quiet holiday which is exactly what we got,1
average,1
1 the room was not clean,0
during our sray the cleaning was verry bad,0
bathroom and sleeping floor not cleaned at all,0
upon our complaint the reaction was we only clean when very dirty,0
2 practically no storage space which is not very convenient,0
french n friendly,1
nice hotel with a friendly and helpful staff but very small rooms,2
found the socks of the previous guest under the bed which tells something about the cleaning efforts,1
there are good patisseries and brasseries nearby so we skipped the hotel breakfast,2
the metro station les gobelins is pretty close and bus stops to take you to the centre or the other side of the river are also nearby,2
and the luxemburg gardens are also in walking distance,1
during the stay we were not able to connect to the wifi not even with the help of the staff,0
so this hotel is well located but don t expect anything beyond basics,1
good location to explore lyon,2
a basic a bit dated hotel but for this price you don t expect more,0
situated across the river form the main city centre but close to one of the bridges so the walk takes only 10 minutes,1
the area around the hotel is not the nicest though,0
the hotel could do with some renovation,1
the check in took quite a bit of time as the guest before me had some questions and they didn t have a second person,1
an alright hotel to stay for a night and explore the city but if you need to stay longer there are probably better options,2
best hotel in frankfurt,2
always is one of the best hotel i ever use,2
last 2 years the day i decide to visit frankfurt i make sure that i will have a nice journey in steigenberger hotel,2
even in hamburg steigenberger hotel is waww,1
my week in hurgada,1
observations non children holiday makers were mixed in with children holiday makers thus noisy and could have been separated as there are at least 2 blocks of rooms,0
what appeared to be eastern europeans were noisy at the pool areas and mostly ignored the no jumping signs they were also rude and pushy at service areas of dining rooms,0
although there is a sign up informing that there are no smoking areas i could not see any actual indication of where they were and the only area a waiter pointed out to me had people smoking probably eastern europeans,0
in uk smoking is not permitted in any indoor areas that are semi public much better for us non smokers,1
excellent hotel,2
have stayed for christmas in this wonderful hotel,2
seems to be brand new staff is very friendly and efficient nice fitness in the eleventh floor and rooms with the view over tallinn,2
good value for money,2
had a short city break with my wife,1
5 minute walk from gran via got off the madrid city tour bus went into the hotel in 15 minutes we were back on tour,1
straight forward and friendly reception personnel kindly helped us to order a table for flamenco with good recommendations to go about town,2
loads of shopping opportunities and brilliant food near by and mostly all of the sight seeng is within the walking distance,2
room was good enough space for two good bedding and towels comfy bed air con good shower and it was surprisingly quite at night,2
a fantastic weekend break at the sea,2
a beautiful beach hotel less than an hour from thessaloniki with fantastic sea view and one of the best beaches organized blue flag i ever visited ideal for a weekend break or a long summer holiday,2
there are many things to do water sports mountain excursions etc,2
my kids were very enthusiastic with the pool there are two and the lift that takes you from pool level to the beach and vice versa,2
the personnel is very friendly there were many facilities beach bar restaurant mini market cafe and the service was at a high level,2
i strongly recommend it,2
very nice hotel very nice room with maisonette,2
breakfast quite expensive but overall very nice hotel very clean and modern,2
i would recommend this hotel both for business as for pleaseure family visit of cologne,2
very good parking possibilties,2
smart and simple,1
this is modern budget hotel near la rambla and montjuic jean miro institute worth seeing,2
staff is very friendly and helpfull which made my stay enjoyable,2
the room itself is different story,1
although it was clean and equipped with basics it felt very cramped,1
i knew i should expect small room but in reality it was very tiny,0
maybe it would be enough space for one person for a couple it may feel crowded,1
still it is nice budget hotel for young travellers,2
and there is small pool on the roof too,1
the great hotel in turkey,2
this place is one of the best for vacation,2
there are all conditions for your pleasure,2
there are a lot of restaurants and bars on the territory of hotel,1
the personnel work excellent,2
excellent location,2
this hotel has an excellent location just across the bridge from the palace of westminster and at walking distance to numerous touristic attractions,2
within 5 minutes walking distance were tube stations and bus stations,1
we enjoyed fast and smooth check in and check out procedures,2
the studio rooms were very spacious luxurious and kept very clean with modern furniture and relaxing colors,2
bathroom is large and good quality toiletries were provided including bathrobes and slippers for the entire family,2
we appreciated the self catering facilities provided and complimentary access to internet,2
definitely we will be back at this hotel next time in london,2
hotel in siena close to railway station,1
the hotel is very close to raliway station 300 m so it was easy to reach friendly staff and the breakfast was ok room is clean and comfortable not very moder but it is ok for 3 star hotel i enjoyed my stay at this hotel and i recommend it for couples who intend to isit siena as it is also close to the city center,2
surprise great food room and service,2
for amsterdam this hotel is good value,2
we were surprised by the excellent cuisine in the hotel,2
front desk is extremely well trained and very positive,2
its also surprisingly close to the train amsterdam amstel station and trams,2
we are glad we chose the casa 400,2
and its quiet too,1
great central location,2
well positioned for city sightseeing and well connected easy access to airport with metro,2
there is a lovely bar in the lobby and staff was friendly and nice as well as very helpfull,2
room was clean bit on the small side but good value for money,2
a very good all inclusive hotel,2
we did not have any higher expectations at all when we arrived to the hotel,0
once we stepped into the hotel lobby everything changed,1
the area looked very luxurous and spacy,2
the hotel room was top class,2
we highly recommend this hotel,2
ann lelle,1
over rated,0
managed to get an executive room for 400 euros for 3 nights inclusive breakfast,1
executive room is just standard size room but better looking and incl small fridge,2
beds are not up to par,0
rooms are noisy eg when somebody is taking a shower u will hear the plumbing cooling off for the next hour a loud ticking noise,0
very akward,0
breakfast very mediocre bread too hard scrambled eggs with melk,0
really gross,0
staff does not talk english very well,0
all in all i would not go there again,0
this hotel is very sneaky and thus experienced in making money,0
conveniently located on södermalm close to the tube,2
i am often on business trips and i know what need,1
apart from a bed i do also ask for a big bathroom which the standard rooms in this hotel offers,1
on the day i had been in a number of meetings so when coming back i did appreciate that the hotel was quiet and offered a restaurant which had a great selection of different foods,2
do try their fish i had a delicious meal that evening,2
the check out was alright two other guests took quite some time to check out and no other member of staff was called to the reception to speed up the checkout process for the other guests,2
beautiful wellness hotel close to city centre koln,2
all in the hotel was possitive,1
but while we got a wellcome drink in the bar all people were smoking,0
all our clothes smell to smoke,0
terrible,0
when we knew this before we shouldn t drink this,0
best place to stay in a very middle of paris,2
very nice hotel situated in the middle of paris next to les halles metro and rer station,2
you can easily find connections to every tourist attractions from there,2
louvre notre dame centre pompidou and river seine are less than 5 mins walk,1
near hotel there are many bars pubs clubs,1
the most disadvantage of the hotel is noise from the fountain situated on square next to the hotel,0
if you wish to have quiet nights choose the room which is not with a view to square,1
rooms with a view on other site are very quiet,1
hotel rooms are equiped with good kitchenete facilities there is toaster electric kettle microwave and dishwasher,2
great holiday,2
our holiday was very nice,2
we had a week in melia hotel and enjoyed it,2
we booked a room with sea view and the view was really amasing,2
the food was good the staff was really helpfull and friendly we felt very good as everywhere everybody was always there to give us information or help,2
the price of the room was very reasonable as well and we will book again now with the early discounts definitely,2
try the sea view room and the bulgarian night with bulgarian food and drinks it s very delicious,2
perfect hotel,2
every thing in the hotel was perfect the location near the river,2
breakfast is wonderfull,2
close to shopping to the restaurant and transfer,1
the stuff very helpfull,2
the room very clean and room service are immidiately come,2
a place between slums and skyscrapers,1
hotel location is close to the center of baku even though it is located in poor area when all the best hotels are located in the seashore,2
it was really hot in baku in july and the main problem in the hotel was bad air conditioner which was hardly working,0
also cleanliness is not the hotel s best side the carpet was always dirty,0
what i liked was a balcony in the room nice bathroom with all necessary things good tv with a lot of channels english russian azerbaijan german and so on,2
the stuff was not really smiling and nice but helped quickly if i asked for,2
hotel titanic beach spa aqua park,1
this hotel was fantastic the staff can t do enough for you,2
they are friendly and funny,2
the food was good and varied the complex is vast and beautiful,2
the rooms are immaculately clean and it is an all inclusive package,2
would definitely stay here again,2
rooms are great but should be separated for smokers and for family with children,1
a lot of staff members but not always efficient as supervicion is oriented for control of procedure instead of control of the result and client satisfaction staff members have to apply strict procedures and finally not really taking care of the result as not responsible for the procedure itself,0
beach activities are linked to tide hours only 3 hours day and c beach club mainly restricted to villa residents even if they are not present,1
great overall vacation part of wedding party,2
the hotel itself is beautiful,2
very spacious and comfortable rooms,2
the villas are nicely laid out across the expansive grounds,2
its basically a luxury cruise ship concept but on land,1
the grounds are very extensive and so the walking can be far from the main buildings,1
however its a good daily exercise,2
cheap yet comfy option 2 days in amsterdam south,2
this hotel lies in the south of amsterdam,1
the area around is not what you expect from amsterdam,0
however a tram stop is less than 5 minutes away walking from the hotel,1
from there it was almost 20 minutes to downtown amsterdam,1
the hotel rooms are ok by european standards,2
might be small for american standards,1
the rooms are very clean and the staff there are very polite and speak excellent english,2
not one of the best choices on the strip,0
this was one of the first few mega resorts on the strip in the 90 s but now it is really starting to show its age,1
the rates are rock low so you pay for what you get for,1
i stayed here as an invited guest and would probably not stay here if i had to pay,0
where did personal service go,1
rooms are super small especially the bathroom always ask for a high floor where it is more quite and the view is better food choice is very limited and not well selected personal service very deteriorating especially concierge services and failure to recognize repeated request for french newspaper instead of english beware of a small step before the elevators coming from the restaurant as a fall would be fatal i suppose the only efficient staff i found during my stay were the bellmen never failing to salute any in out guest with a smile,0
new bed linen has an uncomfortable smell,0
acceptable for a short business trip,1
pretty basic hotel,1
okay for a business trip,1
located not in the very center but not in the very outskirts generally well connected to public transportation,1
not really a touristy area rather business and residential,1
breakfast was standard more or less the same you can find in any business hotel,1
personnel is friendly,2
wi fi is in place but quite slow,1
room is generally fine but some refurbishment would be good,2
probably the biggest complaint no view from the window at all only inner yard,0
the room is pretty dark because of that,0
but this is not a big issue if you are on a business trip,1
for a family stay i would have chosen something different,1
just great,2
it was an awesome time with great animaters espaccely emily amel we miss you we had so much fun in this hotel,2
i just can recommend this hotel to everybody and you should eat at the asian restaurant thats just a dream,2
thank you for this great time i will come back for sure,2
good for bed and breakfast,2
only there for one night so cannot comment on longer stays but usual expected features but possible tired for a hotel with higher expectations,1
we paid a last minute price thus was cheap for this hotel and extremely reasonable compared to other places we had stayed in tuscany,2
had we paid the full price we would have been disappointed as no way worth the usual 130 euros for a small double room,0
nothing grand except the name of the hotel,1
beautiful foyer staff were helpful,2
room was booked using easytobookcom we booked a standard organiser room,1
it was bland dark and a little shabby,0
2nd floor backing on to a delivery alley and bar,1
noisy in the extreme,0
we had earplugs and used them,1
housekeeping was frequent,1
clean enough plenty of hot water,1
though the toilet smelt strongly of urine,0
a large hotel with mostly business folk coming and going,1
we cannot speak for the other rooms available but to give ours a 5 star tag was ridiculous,0
a very good domicile in a attractive environment,2
a very good domicile in a attractive environment it was my first stay in trier and i would like to come back with my family,2
the staff was very friendly and courteous,2
specifically one waitress serving us was very funny and charming at out dinner,2
weekend stay in madrid,1
we stayed at the hostal for two nights at the weekend,1
if you are looking for a cheap hostel in the centre of madrid and do not need any other services it is worth trying,2
anyway there is no chance to have breakfast no restaurant at the hotel,0
on the other hand a big advantage of the hostel is its placement at the very centre of madrid with a walking distance to sol gran via etc i would recommend the hostel only for a short stay in the city,2
we keep coming back,2
what can i say we have been to this hotel for the last 4years the hotel itself is dated but the staff are all great food is good how ever i m vegetarian and for 1 night a week which is fish night i don t eat we have several friends come to the hotel with us with kids between the ages of 2 and 18 and have all lived it the entertainment do a fantastic job and work really hard and make the hotel a fun place to be i guess this is way we keep coming back,2
everything ok,2
for you exspectations and use everything was ok,2
very near to the beach,1
good room and climation,2
no balcony only italien tv no german no english the parking situation is a little chaos but we always find a place the service at breakfast is bad and there are only a few things to eat very loud at the weekends because of event outside,0
nells park hotel,1
very pleasant stay at this hotel,2
we were there only for 2 nights but would have liked to stay longer,1
the surroundings and the park around the hotel was very nice,2
also the staff of the hotel is very helpful and friendly,2
perfect holidays with good food and friendly staff,2
we enjoyed very much,2
food was very good location of the hotel perfect we enjoyed the leisure activities,2
sasha tyson kristina emeli denis very friendly staff,2
thank you,2
jitka and hana from czech republic,1
love this resort,2
all in all everything was very good,2
i can t really complain about anything,1
everything was excellent and i d like to visit this resort again,2
the staff is very friendly and always ready to help with some of them it is a little difficult to talk but it s okay,2
i think this is my new favorite place to go on vacation everything is perfect,2
city break,1
in this day and age to charge euro 2000 for wi fi a day is silly low band should be free in your room,0
this is generally pitched as a business hotel in a business area and therefore should be inclusive,1
relaxing friendly,2
although the hotel was under renovation during my visit it was friendly comfortable,2
i am looking forward to be back in dec after the renovation is completed beginning of nov excellent spot for a brilliant holiday,2
excellent vacationd honeymoon,2
it was the best vacation i ve ever had,2
everything was great the kindness of the staff the food was delicious smiling faces all around you,2
i had the most wonderfull time there having fun all the time,2
overpriced for the service,0
if you are traveling alone for business purpose the hotel is convenient because it is next to the convention center and next to a subway station,2
otherwise i would stay somewhere else,1
it is a very simple hotel the room is very small and there is only a little table that you can also use as a desk,2
the area is residential so not many shopping or dining options around,1
there are little restaurants in the area but they are extremely overpriced,0
no refrigerator in the room and no food at the bar,1
so i recommend that you go back to the hotel after a day of work ready to sleep,1
city of good food,2
the hotel is laying in the real center of lyon and the old parts of town is all around,1
very close there are lots of narrow old streets with shopping of all kind and you can also find excusive cloth boutiques antic shops for books and funiture etc afew blocks away there ia also a large walking street with shopping and restaurants and in every corner you will find bars where you can sit down and rest your legs and cool down with a drink,1
there is a lot of historical place to visit and if interested in real good gastronomic eating then you make a visit to famous paul bocuse restaurant,2
advertised free parking,1
we booked this hotel through priceline,1
our confirmation state free parking which the hotel will not honor,0
at 12 euros per hour this is a scam,0
do not stay here,0
excellent holiday and excellent staff,2
this was our fourth trip to egypt and first to this hotel,1
we were not disappointed as our travel ágent had made a mistake with our booking and the hotel manager sorted it for us efficiently,2
the staff were wonderful and could not have been more welcoming or helpful,2
mainly russian tourists and guests with some germans thrown in but would most definitely return to this hotel in the future as could not fault anything,2
the food variety of and the offer to dine anywhere in any of seven or so different dining rooms in the resort was a bonus,2
definitely worth the money and really enjoyed our stay well done to all the staff we met,2
horrible hotel,0
we took a room there because the hotel du palais which is situated next to hotel moderne didn t have any rooms for a further night in marseille,1
next to the city center port vieuz,1
no elevator,1
the owners don t speak any english,0
we paid with 100 for the room 55 the owners said they don t have any change and we will get it later so we took back the 100 and changed it at a coffeeshop,1
didn t recieve a bill,0
rooms very loud old winows,1
rooms dirty bugs running on th floor,0
bath wasn clean when we recieved the room empty shower bottle from guests before where in shower,1
bad smell in room,0
mould in the shower,1
lovely hotel beside park but long walk to trier,2
the hotel was easy to find had reasonably priced parking and this was our main reason to choose it on our way home from a holiday in france,2
its position beside nells park was lovely and our room was excellent with superb bathroom and shower,2
the decor of the dining rooms was very good but there was less choice of food and wine than we had expected,2
for us the poor choice of german wines was disappointing,0
unfortunately we speak very little german but the staff were very friendly and helpful,2
great and restful place to stay,2
it was our first night in a foreign country and you made us feel like we were at home,2
the breakfast and service you provided the next day was exceptional,2
the staff made us feel very welcome from the time we checked in to our departure,2
thank you,2
everything you wish will be done,1
we had a very nice stay in dana beach with 8 tennisfriends,2
a suggestion i have people from europe are not used to play tennis on concrete underground so an other underground would give more comfort for example imitation grass would be very nice,2
egypts best hotel at hurghada dana beach,2
great and clean rooms good food nice staff so our conclusion about this hotel is that s a super fantastic place to go to and we would like to recomend and invite everybody to book their vacationpickalbatros dana beach,2
i know we will go back that s for sure,2
keep on going with te good work,2
good choice,2
we stayed for just one night in the hotel and our main focus was to do some sight seeing in lyon,1
the hotel is located very close to the subway station and it takes just a few stations to the inner city,2
so the location is very convenient,2
there were parking spaces available in front of the hotel,1
when checking in and out the staff was very friendly,2
our room was spacy and clean and the bathroom was clean as well,2
since we didn t have breakfast i can t judge the restaurant,1
in summary the hotel is a good option for short stays city breaks,2
typical french hotel small grubby but charming,2
hotel massena is perfectly located near opera in paris,2
it is a small hotel which one can easily oversee with all the shops around,2
the street was very alive even in the evening hours,2
however the windows held almost all noise away which made it easy to sleep in the hotel,2
in the morning the hotel provided a good breakfast with fresh juices and typical croissants,2
the room was small but provided everything one needs but also nothing extra,1
the halls are fancy with darker walls,1
probably price is ok because it is paris,2
for other destinations i would think money for value was a little low,1
up to expectations for a holiday inn express,1
we stayed here with a group of 8 people during a short city break,1
the location is great just a few minutes walking from a shopping street area with plenty of shops including a supermarket bars and restaurants,2
the property respected frequent guest status and offered free internet as the property only has 1 room type and no upgrades were available,2
amenities at the hotel are minimal there s not real bar but a vending machine is available on the ground floor with sodas sandwiches and snacks,1
no great luxury but when looking for affordable clean accommodation in a good location then this is your spot,2
noisy very poor room insulation,0
this is my personal experience having spent some days here but haven t got much sleep because of the noise,0
there is no carpet in the hotel instead there is wooden floor which spreads and maximizes the noise from the corridor and other rooms,1
usually you hear the noise even until 3am or 4 am,1
for me this experience is worse than any hostel before,0
excelent place for golf and beach,2
golf courses can be easily reached from the hotel tee times and transport have been organised by the hotel ms ö,2
to my absolut satisfastion i have made a coupple of good rounds so i m satisfied twice,2
hotel offers nice spa large pool area and enough space on its beach where i enjoyed relaxing after the game,2
hospitality and services at the highest level,2
i will definitely come back,2
best in class,1
the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied,2
super fast processor and really nice graphics card,2
was not happy with one of the programs on it,0
i got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced so i was now on the second motherboard within 3 months,1
i bought a protector for my key pad and it works great,2
it s a great product for a great price,2
i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter so it s not just an isolated incident,1
the brand is tarnished in my heart,0
it has many great programs such as ilife iphotos and others,2
toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it,0
this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it,0
a seventy dollar mouse,1
eventually my battery would nt charge so unless i had it plugged in it would nt even power on,0
if you want a little more custom ability drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win 7 and grab a 2gb stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more,2
i will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when i do so i do nt run accross a situation like this again,2
it is also very lightweight making transporting this computer very easy,2
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds,2
after having two pc laptops die with in the past 3 years i was led to the apple display at best buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues,2
pc users work in word while mac users work in pages,1
small enough to use on a long flight light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips,2
battery is lasting about 6 hours as i am surfing the web on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos,1
i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing i took it for granted that these features were standard,1
as a user of a pc i will will admit that the macbook pro has a better running system in which i found myself getting the job done quicker,2
i ve been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory,2
called acer many times they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair center i was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer,0
the tech store i purchased this from sent it back eventually i got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later,1
i can have both osx and windows xp running at the same time,1
i found a 2gb stick for a bit under 50 nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents,2
we have had numerous problems with vista such as adobe flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled internet explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on also the same windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times the same update,0
the rep did not even answer my question i had to ask him if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he did nt even try to acknowledge my question,0
speakers too small to be of any real use,0
now the screen is going darker darker darker,0
it is everything i d hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint but somehow a bit more sturdy,2
i am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite i like the extra features i love the windows 7 home premium,2
even doing so the hinge may just be slightly tightened only,1
the price was very good and the product is top quality,2
the speed is fine,2
well i have to say since i bought my mac i wo nt ever go back to any windows,1
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side,0
there s literally no way to make it sing with vista,0
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor,1
i have had it for about a 1 12 and yes i have had an issue with it one month out of warranty,0
the only thing i would change about it is the mouse keys,1
again decent comp for the price and i was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me,1
it works great for general internet use microsoft office apps home bookkeeping etc,2
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more,2
the 4 usb ports are nice but the two on the side only work now and then,2
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it iphoto imovie iweb itunes garageband is all very helpful as well,2
also hdd secures inside using rails and there is only one set on the main hard drive,1
the gray color was a good choice,2
since i ve had this computer i ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth,2
no tutorials on the display,1
it has come into good use for my finances scheduling my parents business expenses and it is definitely amazing for gaming,2
the battery life has not decreased since i bought it so i m thrilled with that,2
asked the customer service rep,1
a cheaper price should not equal a cheap product,0
its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while i am using it for web browsing uploading photos watching movies 720p on occasion and creating presentations,2
a month or so ago the freaking motherboard just died,0
computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly,0
aside from the trial software and the short battery life lack of a webcam its great,2
ilife is easily compatible with microsoft office so you can send and receive files from a pc,2
the only thing that i do nt like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to,0
i would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a toshiba that is nt good at all,0
then within 5 months the charger crapped out on me,0
a month later we reinstall the os vista,1
with awesome graphics and assuring security it s perfect,2
charger seems large for this class of computer,1
this computer is exceptionally thin for it s screen size and processing power,0
we use the built in tools often itunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iphone,2
the first one sent touchpad did nt work the second sent usb did nt work the third sent touchpad did nt work the fourth sent has nt arrived yet,0
the only downfall is a lot of the software i have wo nt work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it,0
applications respond immediately not like the tired ms applications,1
they only stay charged a little over an hour,1
processor when compared to my 3 week old early 2011 edition there i barely experience any difference in performance 23 ghz vs 24 ghz,1
oh yeah do nt forget the expensive shipping to and from hp,0
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have,2
after 2030 min the screen of the notebook switched off,1
it does not even have the software to play a dvd now,0
though the picture video and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software im used to cs5 but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers,1
the processor screams and because of the unique way that apple osx 16 functions most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software,1
the ilife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product,2
however i love this particular mac because its very fast great size and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad,2
webcam is a bit laggy not the greatest,0
other installed features such as certain printer software are also most attractive,2
i love windows 7 but i ca nt give toshiba any credit for that unless yall get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time,2
the image is great and the soud is excelent,2
windows xp sp2 caused many problems on the computer so i had to remove it,0
i was taught to use photoshop and was amazed,2
the materials that came with the computer did not include the right anywhere,0
the processor a amd semprom at 21 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing,0
very longlife battery up to 1011 hours depending on how you configure power level settings,1
what i d like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory,2
i needed a driver for my hp and they would not help me with out me paying over 50 for it,0
while the keyboard itself is alright the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons,2
it s perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc,2
am very glad i bought it great netbook low price,2
anyway in early july of this year the dvd burner stopped working and the computer stared having issues with power supply,0
i highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door,2
computer has been at service facility more than in my hands,1
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca nt leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying,0
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm,2
not even safe mode boots,0
the machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your hdtv,1
my first problem was with the preloaded norton firewallsecurity program,0
i love its solid build light wt and excellent battery life for now,2
macbook notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life as well as the many background programs that run without the user s knowlede,0
tons of bloatware and junk programs,0
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move,1
oh and if thats not bad enough it does nt come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is 25 for two cds,0
great battery life,2
also because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer some websites would nt even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems,0
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three usb ports,2
my wireless system would not recognize windows 7 and i could nt get online to find out why,0
delivery was early too,1
after that the said it was under warranty,1
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped,0
very fast boot up and shut down,1
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service,0
the port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca nt see the plug at all it s just gone,1
i also liked the glass screen,2
another thing i might add is the battery life is excellent,2
runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better,2
the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours,2
the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks,0
so i called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all i just chose to hide the message,2
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome,2
the display is awesome,2
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software you guys were great too,2
however i may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton,0
they are about the same size keys,1
i just took the broken cords into the apple store and they gave me new ones,2
but other than that i am blown away by all the features this laptop offers,2
the keyboard feels good and i type just fine on it,2
excellent led monitor and well equipped,2
it did fairly well other than it s poor performance overheating and occational blue screen,2
the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot,1
it took toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem,1
simple to use and great graphics,2
the battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were sol there to so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased,0
again the same problem the right speaker did not work,0
the black model also has a very nice seamless appearance one of the better looking notebooks i ve seen,2
it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in mousing over the battery icon would read for example 74 plugged in not charging requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge,1
took me 11 hours 3 trips to different fedex offices and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse it support technicians in the world,0
enabling the battery timer is useless,0
again windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with,0
garageband is more for the musicians and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level,2
i wish it had a webcam though then it would be perfect,2
i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent,0
my macbook is so much better looking and so thin,2
also my sister got the exact same laptop since they were so cheap and after 8 months the screen split in half just from everyday use,2
for me keys were starting to get stuck and would nt type very well,0
the speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better,0
the processor went on me the fan went and the motherboard went,1
with a mac you do nt have to worry about antivirus software or firewall it s so wonderful,2
even so i like playing online games so it was wonderful that there is a feature where i can dualboot windows,2
it has no camera but i can always buy and install one easy,2
i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use stylish fun awesome computer,2
also macbooks come with much more features which are so cool,2
of course i inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and i even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others,1
in fact somehow and i never opened it up some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently behind the front of the screen in the way of the display,0
maximum sound is nt nearly as loud as it should be,0
i use the computer to basically check emails surf the web print coupons and for my college papers,1
i think part of the problem with this computer is vista yet i know vista is nt the entire issue because my latest purchase was my acer and it also has vista i should have waited the few months to get the next operating system,0
i am constantly trying to uninstall programs clean cookies and delete unused files,0
i loved the netbook minus the fact that it was windows os until this started happening,2
no problem with the ordering or shipping by the way,1
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at i think there s something to be said about the simplicity of macs,2
laptop is advertised as a 15 but the casing looks like that of a 17,1
best buy 5 stars sales service respect for old men who are nt familiar with the technology dell computers 3 stars dell support owes a me a couple,2
games being the main issue,0
there is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark,2
the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues,0
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet,2
everything about the mac is not only visually appealing but very easy to use,2
it was hard to handle and operate at school,0
everything about a mac is wonderful it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system but you will learn fast and its all worth it,2
the resolution on the screen is almost pure hd,2
it has a faster processor and more ram,2
it was very easy to just pick up and use it did not take long to get used to the mac os,2
treat yourself to a more expensive longlasting laptop of quality like a sony apple or toshiba,1
i purchased this netbook after my original toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired,0
i think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive but i rather have a hard copy,1
system is loosing about 20 of performance because of that,0
after purchasing this thing i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera and that it can not be purchased at the store only on line,0
it is absolutely horrible to use despite all its so called advanced features,0
the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the repair,1
quality display i love hp it s the only computerprinter we will buy,2
i can render avchd movies with little effort which was a problem for most pc s unless you had a quad core i7,1
i have vista so i am unable to install and uninstall some programs,0
you know using the computer should be fun not aggrevation especially when you are playing games or working with photos,1
this is a great value for the money,2
this computer i used daily nice compact design,2
i do nt have stupid pop up windows even when i have pop ups blocked i do nt have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download and best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down,2
the keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops i have had in the past,2
i took it back for an asus and same thing blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset,1
i was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that i was looking for,2
battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery,1
the screen is framed by half to a fullinch margin that is obviously unnecessary reduces the screen size and increases the bulk,0
either the computer is too slow to detect the keys typed this is unlikely as i am a slow typist or the keyboard simply does not detect the keys being typed,0
the laptop is relatively simple to use though i bought macs for dummies which is well worth 2,2
i also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store,1
it is easy to go from one keyboard to another,2
they gave me a hard time yet again but their was a malfunction in the battery itself it did nt die,0
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca nt be used with the ibook,1
then one month after the warranty expired the replacement charger went,0
it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer,2
screen is crystal clear yes it s small but it s a netbook,1
i have had another mac but it got slow due to an older operating system,0
the only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time,0
this time the mouse pad and right click key would nt work,0
the system it comes with does not work properly so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all,0
summary hp knew they were shipping out bad bios and did nothing proactive to resolve it,0
i love the way the entire suite of software works together,2
my one complaint with this laptop is that i ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in,0
the macbook starts fast does nt crash has a fantastic display is small and light i have the 133 model and is nt always complaining about updates lost connections errors blue screens etc,2
my macbook pro works like a dream it has never overheated or even been slightly warm for that matter,2
i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute,1
if you buy this do nt go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life and you ll be perfectly satisfied,2
but we had paid for bluetooth and there was none,1
the tech guy then said the service center does not do 1to1 exchange and i have to direct my concern to the sales team which is the retail shop which i bought my netbook from,0
this laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly,2
its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer,2
in the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced,0
when i called toshiba they would not do anything and even tried to charge me 35 for the phone call even though they did nt offer any technical support,0
windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs,0
now mainboard is broken have to wait for a new one,0
my friend just had to replace his entire motherboard so did my wife and it looks like i will have to as well,0
i always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times,1
did i mention everything about it from size to weight to keyboard screams bulk,0
besides the great look it is a great machine,2
it s applications are terrific including the replacements for microsoft office,2
great value fast delivery computer works as if brand new no problems very pleased,2
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan,1
overall i experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old pc,2
actually i had noticed the one on the sales floor also did nt have sound,1
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot,1
the only thing i did nt learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection in case it gets broken or crashes etc,0
and the ram the thing that makes it faster comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before,2
it had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use and would not move past this error,0
its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching movies,2
and looks very sexyy d really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price,2
yes the computer was light weight less expensive than the average laptop and was pretty self explantory in use,2
i love the size keyboard the functions,2
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive,1
i did not have to call the support line at all,1
when i got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then i started expeirencing issues again everything from programs and drivers failing again to it powering off for no reason to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues,0
it works exactly like it did the day i took it out of the box,2
i had of course bought a 3 year warranty so i sent it in to be replaced and almost 2 months later the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement,1
i reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again,2
the magnetic plugin power charging power cord is great i even put it to the test by accident excellent innovation,2
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate,2
once open the leading edge is razor sharp,1
the programs are great like iphoto love the editing capabilities imail which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad imovie etc,2
the pricing is very competitive,1
clear picture on it and everything,1
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it,0
it is not ideal for children because of the temp,0
waiting for the i7 was well worth it great value for the price,2
keyboard could use some trimming,1
it works really well,2
at first the computer seemed a great deal seemingly highend specs for a low low price,2
i noticed windows has a new system called windows 7 what about us vista users they should get all the bugs out of vista before investing in a new system,1
maybe this is virus related maybe not but the computer has locked up many times and on two occasions the screen has simply gone black,0
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria,2
the material this pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any pc specs like i said this performs a lot better than any computer i ve had in the past,2
the games included are very good games,2
that system is fixed,1
going to bring it to service today,1
cosmetically the only thing they changed was 2 of the function keys at the top,1
i thought learning the mac os would be hard but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc,2
purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out,2
all of the programs keynote pages numbers have an option to save your documents as microsoft compatible which really eliminates the need for the actual,2
the letter a stopped working after the first week,0
i find myself using the 10key more than i thought i would,1
its a good laptop for its value,2
after doing extensive research macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 mbp i5,1
my problem was with dell customer service,0
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook screen size is not something i d stare at for the entire 1011 hours of battery life five days a week,0
i hope to edit this in the next few hours i am going to try to install my own copy of windows 7,2
overall the computer is very easy to use the screen is perfect great computer my daughter loves,2
they say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive i do nt really understand why but anyway,0
i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it,0
i had been a windows linux user before this i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for internet artwork and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable,2
wonderful zooming,2
i would tell the technician i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in,0
i had my iworks itunes email ms office network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour,2
my daughter uses it for games email facebook pictures and music,1
little short on ram but you get what you pay for,1
not easy to carry,0
temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in core processing unit temperatures,1
the internet speed is spectacular,2
i v spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook of course a different brand,1
not to mention the battery life is absolutely amazing,2
runs smooth and quick,1
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use,0
pc never worked right even after bios fixed,0
i ve owned this labtop for less then two months already the mouse button has broke,0
it has easy to use features and all the speed and power i could ask for,2
comes with imovie,1
iphoto is probably the best program i have ever worked with easy and convenient,2
taking it back to best buy i found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken manuf issue,0
it s priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box,2
long story but after many calls to various offices i was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do nt take phone calls or emails,0
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlledlighting environment like me i prefer it dark or if you can crank up the brightness,1
the os is also very user friendly even for those that switch from a pc with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os,2
called tech support and got the usual acer we do nt support software but for we can help you i explained there was no software involved in booting,1
they sent out a sony certified technician,1
one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it the next day i turn it on no gui screen all dark power light steady hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does,0
i have found it very easy to use very imformative wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs,2
tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again,1
i also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen,0
i now realize that my 900 would have been better spent on a windows laptop,1
we carry the netbook around here and there hence it s kinda of irritating when the lcd just slide downwards,0
the mouse is way way way to sensitve,1
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned,1
the motherboard is dead,0
the casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket,0
a great feature is the spotlight search one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document,2
also kinda loud when the fan was running,1
but the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 247,0
the size is perfect and i do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you,2
sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst,0
the backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark,2
it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer was a six month trial,1
the neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons,2
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her it s very lightweight and the response for the computing she s doing internet focused activity mail research etc is excellent,2
i also purchased office max s max assurance with the no lemon clause,1
so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good,0
purchased for development purposes but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing email etc,2
granted it s still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops my mac boots up noticeably quicker,2
but to be honest the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll buy a pc next time,1
one more tip please purchase this model and get a 4gb stick of ram to save you 10,1
the best thing to do is build your own computer but if u ca nt company s like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple 2000 systems and if you google dell coupons you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price,2
and the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming,2
there is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer,0
another included program that is laughable is the chess game,0
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space,2
the only thing i can imagine is that sony jumped on early specifications for vista requirements from microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements,1
amazing quality,2
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction,0
the computer itself was fast ran smoothly and had no problems,2
its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes,2
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk,0
the dv4 boasted a faster processor more memory and a bigger hard drive than my old computer plus a better quality web cam nicer screen and many other features,2
speaking of the browser it too has problems,0
the driver updates do nt fix the issue very frustrating,0
the apple will run internet explorer but at an amazingly slow rate,1
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork,0
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working 3 months of use which was frustrating,0
wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time,0
the screen is huge and coloful but no led backlighting,1
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i d have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty,0
you can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover pc software that you absolutely can not be without,2
peformance is good for the price,2
not too much junk software to remove,0
the i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos,0
still under warrenty so called toshiba no help at all,0
it s so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with,2
but guess what you have to buy an external dvd drive it does nt have a built in type the notebook ca nt be used because it does nt read anything for an external drive,1
mine came at 1700 wo a dvd burner,1
unfortunately apple s quality has continued to slide,0
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running,0
i took 34 years researching brands and prices of laptops,1
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the external keyboard mouse and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video,2
i love this program it is superior to windows movie maker,2
everything is so easy to use mac software is just so much simpler than microsoft software,2
i feel that it was poorly put together because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it,0
i had in the past a dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it,1
i have found also it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access,2
the layout of the macbook is horrible and confusing,0
this is my second one and the same problem bad video card unreliable overall this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy,0
there is no cd drive on the computer which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd,0
the touchpad is very intuitive so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again,2
connecting to my wireless router via builtin wireless took no time at all,2
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the mac offers,2
i love my apple it is quick and easy to use,2
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price but you can not find the look easy applications and the experience in mac,2
i thought the price was great for the specs,2
everything about this computer is easy to use,2
in all honesty if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal sized laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop then do not buy this computer,0
keyboard is reasonable size,2
after way too many times sending the thing in for repairs delivery service was slow and without the laptop i had no access to the internet and thus no way of tracking it to find out when i might hope to see my computer again it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years,0
was very much worth the price i paid,2
your cursor will end up all over the freaking place it s not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words sentences paragraphs because of this mousepad,0
the extended warranty for the 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu,1
also i issued a replacement rma for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen which is noticable to me,0
acer has set me up with free recovery discs when they are available since i asked,1
the toshiba laptop i am using is easier to use than most i have tried,2
upgrading from windows 7 starter thru windows 7 home premium to windows 7 professional was a snap,2
i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l305ds5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty,2
i especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys,2
have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing which is leaps and bounds ahead of pc in my opinion,2
i dual boot with linux and that other securityprone os and it performs flawlessly,2
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault,0
it was heavy bulky and hard to carry because of the size,0
good keyboard long battery life largest hard drive and windows 7,2
hard disk the new editions gives you more hard disk space 500gb instead of 320gb but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk,0
the first problem is that the keyboard function is simply unsatisfactory,0
great product by apple with the new great looking design,2
the body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up,1
my husband uses it mostly for games email and music,1
it was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax,2
i propose that i can just swap the hard drives,1
the repairs were made quickly though i must say however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me,1
i have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop,2
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat,0
this laptop looks great on the surface 17 inch screen good pricepoint nice appearance boots up quickly runs fast etc,2
it weighed like seven pounds or something like that,1
it gives me the power and speed that i need to run all the programs i use to edit,2
they say it could be the motherboard again but dell,1
it has a 10 hour battery life when you re doing web browsing and word editing making it perfect for the classroom or office and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ll have a battery life of just over 5 hours,2
this laptop meets every expectation and windows 7 is great,2
this wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought,0
wonderful features,2
it is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on pc s,2
the only thing i wish is the 15 inch macbook pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard,2
the graphics and screen are stunning and although i was a pc person i was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly,2
if a website ever freezes which is rare its really easy to force quit,0
fast great visual,2
ive had to call tech support many times,0
the speakers on it are useless too,0
first of all they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty i d paid almost 400 for and i had to call in spend hours on their online chat service and fax in multiple documents,0
i looked around and based off my price features comparison from a brand i trusted i landed here,1
from the build quality to the performance everything about it has been subpar from what i would have expected from apple,0
they said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not sony itself anymore,1
i was told by many that it was a great computer but we got one of these and it worked great for one year and as soon as the warrenty was up then it got really bad,0
it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my desktop machine,2
the keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard,2
the mouse buttons are hard to push,0
the only downfall is the battery only last 1520 hrs when not plugged in,0
there are several programs for school or office use pages numbers keynote etc music garageband photo management photo booth iphoto videoediting or moviemaking imovie etc,1
typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on,0
however the multitouch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you re gaming,1
love this laptop wonderful price for what you get,2
but now i have realized its a problem with this brand,0
the reality was it heated up very quickly and took way too long to do simple things like opening my documents folder,0
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer,1
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets and rather quickly too,0
hp said it was out of warranty,1
i had to pay for the shipping,0
i ca nt say enough of how satisfied i am with their product and help aftermarket,2
the abuse is that i pushed the power plug in too hard,0
i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff,1
i especially like the backlit keyboard,2
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years i find not much difference except of course for the screen size,1
4 laptop still did not work blue screen within a week,0
the leather carrying case keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from memphis warehouse,1
after sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish i broke down and spent another 100 to get microsoft word for mac,0
i propose that they can just swap the hard drives,1
i run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs i do not want to buy a mac version of like my cad programs,0
first you ll discover that the word processing program known as appleworks rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer if it translates at all,0
also the display is exceptional,2
i bought it from hsn because it was bundled with extra software but as it turns out that software just crashes it more often,0
externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit and the screen has a terrible glare,0
disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price,0
the track pad to me is what really stands out though you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad awesome thinking apple,2
he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started,2
i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity because it is very sensitive,0
a longer battery life would have been great but it meets it s spec quite easily,2
in addition there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture,1
i actually had the hard drive replaced twice the mother board once the dvd drive twice then they finally agreed to replace it all of this in less than 1 12 years,1
the screen graphics and clarity and sharpness are great,2
we figure that after everything his pc actually ended up costing 350 more than my original mac,0
i should have checked this before i installed my applications,0
programs would crash all the time and it turned out to be a very unstable unreliable laptop for me,0
i like those programs better than office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the office programs as well,2
the screen brightness automatically adjusts,1
it was secure and easy to navigate,2
design very durable,2
it s fast it s easy easy easy to set up easy to hook to my wireless network,2
it s graphics are nt bad at all for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics,2
the store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do nt even recommend the hp brand because of the problems with their warrentys,1
the screen is a little glary and i hated the clicking buttons but i got used to them,0
this computer does nt do that well with certain games it ca nt play some and it becomes too hot while playing games,0
also the battery is completely shot,0
i have only had pcs with windows before so this takes a little getting use to,1
after a little more than a year of owning my macbook pro the monitor has completely died,0
it is light and the battery last a very long time,2
the powerpoint opened seamlessly in the apple and the mac hooked up to the projector so easily it was almost scary,2
i reloaded with windows 7 ultimate and the bluetooth and fingerprint reader software would not load,0
the graphics were awful and the warranty is nt even worth the cheap payment on the computer,0
apparently there is a manufacturing defect something with the amount of thermal paste,0
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months,2
the key bindings take a little getting used to but have loved the macbook pro,2
the mouse is a little bit different than what you re used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two separate ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly,1
i was originally concerned that i could nt view work i had done in college on my mac because of the pc formatting but i was even more thrilled to learn of programs like ilife and iwork that allow you to convert your pc documents into readable files on macs,2
also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable easy to use computer,2
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space,1
one drawback i noticed was sound quality via usb,0
i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word processing spreadsheets and presentations similar to microsoft office,1
there are no gold key numbers too intall programs you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time,0
love the graphics awesome programs including garageband and really cool default background,2
came fully loaded good,2
it was super easy to set up and is really easy to get used to,2
no complaints with their desktop and maybe because it just sits on your desktop and you do nt carry it around which could jar the hard drive or the motherboard,1
yes i thought the expese was a little much but i now realize you get what you pay for,0
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase,1
dell s customer disservice is an insult to it s customers who pay good money for shoddy products,0
the display is beyond horrible,0
it was still working but there was nothing on the screen,1
i agree with the previous comment that asus tech support is horrible which is a con in my opinion,0
it discharges too quickly,0
this is a great little computer for the price,2
keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling,0
being a pc user my whole life it s taking a bit of time to adapt to the os of a mac but i m finding my way around,1
skype is just so dang cool with this machine too,2
u can do what u want in just few seconds even to start up your computer takes few seconds,2
i also love the small convenient size of my laptop making it a perfect tool for my academic studies,2
from the getgo the m6809 was unsteady in its operation,1
i am not much of a computer techie so i can understand some of the internal problems though i do have trend micro as an antiviral program,1
i love windows 7 which is a vast improvment over vista,2
my main reason to convert was the imovie program,1
the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes,0
the ac power port becomes loose over time,1
the speed difference is next to nothing for a mac and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a 60 500gb external hard drive,1
mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free,2
info windows failed to load because the kernal is missing or corrupt,0
it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs,2
great wifi too,2
high price tag however,1
it had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one,1
the service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was nt able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect,0
this is a review of windows vista system,1
all the programs are easy and straight forward on my macbook pro it is clean and organized which i always strive to be myself,2
i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front,1
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke,1
three the mac book has advantages over pcs with linux based os there is very few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac,2
the dvd drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well which is annoying,0
the touch pad is fine again it s a real touch pad,2
features such as the dashboard allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator weather forecast movie times calendar computer post its etc,2
while lacking some of the functions of the other versions this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer,2
but you must get the 15 inch,1
the screen resolution was exactly what i was looking for,2
in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a new issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they expedited the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed by a senior tech,1
i will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day,0
it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of laptops,2
even though it is running snow leopard 24 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel,1
the best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features,2
looks nice but has a horribly cheap feel,0
the battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it,2
it seemed to be a very nice laptop except i was not able to load my garmin gps software or microsoft office 2003,2
this laptop is a great price and has a sleek look,2
in the shop these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it get it home break the seal and use it very clever con,2
i bought this lap top and the charge time dose nt last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours,1
screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive,2
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba,1
i was loving this netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me even after installing new browsers then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime i booted it,2
the 2 gb of ram is plenty able to run windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown,2
i had 3 months when the ports started going out,1
4 ram slots 2 hdd bays 16gb ram support no wireless issues at least for me,1
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle and when i click on it it says consider replacing your battery and it does not hold full charge,0
they need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to us based customer service agents for those who live in the united states,0
overall this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from,2
but i needed a laptop for school use,1
summary they played games with me for the warranty period,1
it was loaded with windows vista home premium delivered with only 1gb of ram and it was a dog,1
i like how the mac os is so simple and easy to use,2
i could nt believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge,2
reason why it s because when you buy it you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop the price will stay the same for the next year and even if apple does decides to change mode your laptop value will only drop 1020 unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80,1
they had to replace the motherboard in april,1
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired,1
i know there are way better laptops out there for the same price and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls,0
the macbook is also made better my computer has never got a virus and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day i bought it,2
good monitor and performed well,2
sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer,2
and printing from either word processor is an adventure,1
keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel,2
it has far exceeded my expectations for power storage and abilitiy,0
we researched and found the best price at macconnection,2
i run dreamweaver final cut pro 7 photoshop safari firefox msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time,1
good for every day computing and web browsing,2
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications,0
now for the hardware problems,0
i love the keyboard,2
seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ie internet tabs programs etc simultaneously,1
again i sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside,1
you will need them if you want to reload the os i recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal,2
although the price is higher then dell laptops the macbooks are worth the dough,2
i do nt use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it s perfect for me,2
a second problem involves the battery which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service,0
the apple care has never failed me and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well,2
i made a photo book as a gift on my computer pushed buy and it drew from my itunes account and sent the book to my house the book was of perfect qualityexactly how i had created it and looked better than i had even imagined,2
i was also able to install and use my photoshop and aftereffects programs easily,2
i had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was,0
i work in film editing and post production so i need a laptop that not only has power but memory and speed as well,2
they are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with,2
the unibody construction is solid sleek and beautiful,2
although i do believe that windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems,0
and at one point they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop i bought the memory stick they recomended,0
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you ca nt find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small,0
it caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours,0
in addition all the design tools on pages and keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations,2
the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions,0
in due course i ll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs in the trash,0
for some odd reasons the computer does nt reconize the operation system,0
it has a lot of memory and a great battery life,2
none of the techs at hp knew what they were doing,0
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse,0
the graphics on this computer are also stellar very clear and vivid,2
compared to similarly spec d pcs this machine is good value well built and works easily right out of the box,2
not using wired lan not sure what thats about,0
more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet connection or the page ca nt be displayed,0
the software is amazing,2
also you may need to charge it once a day if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it,2
the screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze,1
i m tired of the inept service,0
the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse,0
when i am next to my router on my hp i get full service on my eee pc i get 3 bars,1
i had read online that some users were having sound problems,0
the flaws are this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x,0
beta had better quality but vhs became the industry standard,1
next most acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop,1
i also did not like the loud noises it made or how the bottom of the computer would get really hot,0
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my macbook pro was worth every dollar,2
apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth they come loose,1
you ca nt even get a satellite card which is why i bought to begin with,1
when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed,0
has a 56 hour battery life,1
this system came loaded with windows 7 starter,1
it was slow locked up and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months,0
the keyboard is too slick,0
i was nt a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed,2
my last computer a toshiba cost only 400 and worked like a charm for many years,2
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that does nt require a dedicated video card,2
obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the human interface,2
setting would change for some reason the screen size would change on it s own like the pixel sizes and whatnot,1
the features are great the only thing it needs is better speakers,2
i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio,2
take your time and go through the tutorials patiently,1
and that probably explains why i ve already had my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it,0
it is easy to use and lightweight,2
with what i do know how to do the computer works beautiful,2
theres also idvd a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together photos recordings video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents family siblings and any other person important in your life that there may be,2
how toshiba handles the repair seems to vary some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix others had the repair done 5 times,1
thus when you carry it at a slanted angle the screen will topple or slide down if you understand what i mean,1
i even got my teenage son one because of the features that it offers like ichat photobooth garage band and more,2
i ordered through macmall which saved me the sales tax i would have incurred buying locally,1
the acer one computer that i bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it but i like the big screen on it,2
when i called sony the customer service was great,2
then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up not able to connect,0
if you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should nt check the activity monitor app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero,1
sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size,1
the laptop preformed pretty well,2
great laptop for school easy to use for beginners in the household,2
this purchase opened me to the world of macbooks and i am impressed with the intuition of the design the beauty of the product and the excellent technological advances associated with it,2
i loaded windows 7 via bootcamp and it works flawlessly,2
the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she d recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook,2
comfterbale to use light easy to transport,1
true quality at a great price,2
i am forever changed and will no longer buy a windows based machine for personal use,0
i hate the display screen and i have done everything i could do the change it,0
when battery life went to 4 hours or less took it to the machouse amsterdam for repair 26th of august,1
i love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new toshiba works great on both,2
this just keeps having it s hard drive replaced,0
my laptop now has no battery,0
spent 2 hours on phone with hp technical support,1
sound card is limited though,1
only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor such as works for windows but iwork is cheap compared to office,1
keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable,2
features like the font are very blocklike and old school,0
mostly i love the drag and drop feature,2
it is a real touchpad not the toy i saw in other brands,1
the only problems are the sound isnt very loud i have to wear headphones,0
the sound is a bit quiet if you re on a plane this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones,2
i connect a lacie 2big external drive via the firewire 800 interface which is useful for time machine,2
for the not so good i got the stock screen which is very glossy,1
i guess he was the technical person,1
sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer,0
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing,2
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare,1
laptops are usually used on the go so why not give you a better battery,1
the only thing that can be updated is the video other than that you re all set,1
we also use paralles so we can run virtual machines of windows xp professional windows 7 home premium windows server enterprise 2003 and windows server 2008 enterprise,1
i was disappointed when i realized that the keyboard does nt light up on this model,0
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac,2
strengths well shaped weaknesses a bad videocard,1
i never had this kind of quality issue with dell not to say dell is that great not with a brand new laptop,0
with windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must,2
it did nt come with any software installed outside of windows media but for the price i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product,2
it pretty much does everything we could ever need and looks great to boot,2
keyboard is great very quiet for all the typing that i do,2
it is good to know that i can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life,2
now i had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the geek squad i found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one so back it went to get the correct drive,0
i m still within the one year warranty but the repair depot has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered,0
strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed this device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers,2
with the upgraded memory the macbook pro never has an issue running many many applications at once,2
the battery life was shorter than expected,0
even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty,1
i also got the added bonus of a 30 hd monitor which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh,2
the touchpad is extremely sensitive which is the only drawback,0
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works,2
2 months later the battery went,1
it is short on space and downloads always had problems being completed or were said to be corrupted,0
since i keyboard over 100 wpm i look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard no keys sticking or lagging strange configuration of extra key etc,1
after much effort and 10 days asus replaced itthe wifi is very weak,0
i bought this laptop and found its tab is not functioning,0
the screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution,2
because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time we are on the hook for the repair,0
after numerous calls to applecare tech support i was directed to send in my computer,1
i was sorly disapointed to discover that hp what i thought was a reputable company would nt honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart,0
the ati graphics card is a huge plus definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a intel builtin card would have trouble with such as halflife 2 or even world of warcraft,2
the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new arm piece and they did nt even request for a receipt,1
not to mention it has shit gigs,0
also the speakers are not very loud but it is a netbook,1
it is easy to use fast and has great graphics for the money,2
many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed,0
quality display i was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop,2
the only bad part is the size weight,0
additional caveat the base installation comes with some toshibaspecific software that may or may not be to a user s liking,1
os x is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time,2
most everything is fine with this machine speed capacity build,2
i ve have nt had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off,0
i personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers,2
with notes saying they replaced the hard drive,1
took several hours with customer support before i could even start the pc out of the box,0
some features arent friendly volume wheel sound quality etc,0
second hdd cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one,0
the amd turin processor seems to always perform so much better than intel,2
it is always reliable never bugged and responds well,2
the mac snow leopard os is extremely easy to use although very different than win xp visa or win7,2
its also fun to use,2
its not just slow on the internet its slow in general,0
i thought the white mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing,0
the program came with the computer and works beautifully,2
no temporary replacement they are out of replacements because many computers had problems with the nvidia chipset inquired status of repair,0
support has been lackluster and now i just want a refund,0
so i took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up,2
i used to build my own desktops from the component parts and recently my 7 year old pentium 4 with ht 1 gb ram sata desktop stopped working this was a rock star 7 years ago,1
enjoy that toshib force and durability unparalleled,2
it had a seventeen inch screen which i wanted but i did nt realize at the time it would be such a monster,1
i bought a cordless mouse for it but do nt always take it out,1
my toshiba did not have sound on everything just certain things,1
the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box all the functions works great,2
the keyboard has a wonderful nature feel,2
it is very easy to type on and feels great besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted,2
the price is great for this model i only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room,2
it did not have all the features i expected it to have,0
how does the power supply not work,0
it s super fast and a great value for the price,2
another issue i have with it is the battery,0
all i will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap vaio,1
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better but am very happy with the upgrade,2
i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows 7 on it by using the vmware program,2
microsoft word was not on it andi had to buy it seperately,0
my laptop cost approximately 2300 and died after only 2years 10months and 18days of use,0
the ibook backup also uses a firewire connection,1
i also purchased applecare for 300 which is a three year extended warranty since i ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two,2
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook,2
i took it in to the apple store and guess what they fixed it no cost out of pocket,2
the capabilities using that program alone made me want a mac,2
sure the initial out of pocket expense is greater but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet and when i factor in all the money in that i wasted on geek squad and the latest patches to decorrupt my infested pcs it probably comes out about even anyhow,0
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever,1
the only thing i do nt understand is that the resolution of the screen is nt high enough for some pages such as yahoo mail,0
the fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or do nt want to bother them with bright lighting it is very convenient to have a darker softer lit screen,2
it s so bad that i m thinking i only got half a battery or something,0
on my powerbook g4 i would never use the trackpad i would use an external mouse because i did nt like the trackpad,0
i use my mac all the time i love the software the way it takes a short time to load things how easy it is to use and most of all how you do nt have to worry about viruses,2
this computer will last you at least 7 years thats an amazing life spanned an electronic,2
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks,0
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear the keyboard and the fit just feels right,2
great laptop that offers many great features,2
i had a usb connect but i ca nt use it because it is not compatible,0
microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems,0
the shop will definitely push the problem to the service center,0
the computer runs extremely slowly whether opening word or my computer,0
the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price,1
now my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months,0
it could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have ddr5 instead of ddr3,2
also i have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly,0
i m having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying 176 every 3 months just is nt worth it that s about how long the port seems to last,0
finally the biggest problem has been tech support,0
my only issues are 1 the screenvideo resolution wo nt increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60,0
the programs that come standard with the leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics,1
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened and they tell you that it was not on their side then you are stuck paying for the repair the price of a new one,0
it s fast and has excellent battery life,2
startup in about 30 seconds shutdown in 24 seconds resume from sleep in 02 seconds,1
the battery life is probably an hour at best,0
previous laptops were pc s still have them but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system,2
i get a ton of compliments on its size and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you re restricted to the width of your body for computing room,2
a mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense,2
touchpad will take a bit of time to get used to,1
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality,2
one drawback i wish the keys were backlit,1
of course for a student weight is always an issue,1
it is very well built,2
i had it four months when my disc drive refused to open,0
there is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import,1
have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed etc,0
the large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like adobe creative suite,2
apparently well built and gorgeous to look at the i5 macbook pro is a winning combination of price and performance,2
first things first macbook pro has many applications to make life easier unlike the windows computers,2
the battery life before the battery completely died of course left much to be desired,0
all for such a great price,2
seems like maybe a bad shipment from toshiba,0
well i started using google chrome which is a little better but it freezes too sometimes,1
the screen is bright and clear the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice,2
the one thing i wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel,1
theres a built in camera with special effects for video and photography,1
i definitely suggest getting an extended warranty you will probably need it,2
i need graphic power to run my adobe creative apps efficiently,1
the hard drive crashed as well and i had to buy a new power cord,0
the 17 inch screen is very large but the computer is very light,2
also i have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines,0
and it comes with the new osx that comes with new features that makes the use more easy,2
the operating system and user interface is very intuitive and the large multitouch track pad is amazing,2
i upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows 7 starter to win 7 home and it runs just fine,2
great laptop for the price works well with action pack games,2
i love a pc but i was ready for a change and tired of the windows system,2
a coupla months later they change my hard drive,1
and if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed,2
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east,0
supplied software the software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what windows comes with,2
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch,1
but when i received my replacement i made both recovery dvds 4 and a driverapplication dvd,1
we upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed,1
the battery life is also relatively good,2
was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued apparently because of known motherboard problems,0
i am using the external speaker sound is good,2
web access through the 3g network is so slow it s very frustrating and very disappointing,0
the quality engineering design and warranty are superior covers damage from dropping the laptop,2
i use this for my tutoring business and since i m always bouncing from student to student it is ideal for portability and battery life yes it gets the 8 hours as advertised,2
there is no need to purchase virus protection for mac which saves me a lot of time and money,2
excellent speed for processing data,2
accordingly i have decided to never purchase another hp product my five year old compaq lasted 5years before the hard drive crashed,0
who could nt love a dvd burner 80gigabyte hd and fairly new graphics chip as i soon discovered though there is a reason for which similarlyconfigured sony and toshiba machines cost more they use higherquality components that are faster betterconfigured and end up lasting a lot longer,2
the screen is bright and the keyboard is nice,2
the battery has never worked well,0
i have other computers that get strong signals that do nt drop in places that this net book loses its signal,1
this is what i call a good after sales service,2
the speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly and multiple at a time if you sowish,2
love the stability of the mac software and operating system,2
it has 3 usb ports 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion,1
it s also fairly easy to use the operating system,2
after 2 months of complaints asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies,1
either way the keyboard is unsatisfactory,0
when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem,0
another three weeks later i had my laptop back with a new mousepad keys and casing,2
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it,2
the keyboard is top notch,2
also if you need to talk to a representive at microsoft there is a charge which i believe is robbery since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system which most people would have went with xp if they could,0
but sadly the replacement frozeup while updating the bios again and shut down and would not turn back on,0
it is easy to use has great screen quality and every so light weight,2
i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed,0
with a mac computer i have more free time as i do nt have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows,1
there also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files,0
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation,0
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old word processer which works good,1
i already have a hp laptop i bought last year that s standard size,1
i would like at least a 4 hr battery life,1
like the price and operation,1
my opinion of sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market given their horrible support but this machine just caused another plunge,0
the nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year,1
then i ve fixed the dc jack inside the unit rewired the dc jack to the outside of the laptop replaced the power brick,1
was searching online for a power supply when i found this site,1
i know what 7 hrs of battery looks like,1
the screen shows great colors,2
as a lifelong windows user i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac,2
at first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and i send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again,0
i acually believe the issue is with the nvidia grafics card but still requires a return,1
the only downfall is the volume control,0
even out of warranty,1
i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired,0
no tey do nt even support their own bios and it could be a problem with the bios how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity,0
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty,1
they also use two totally different operating systems,1
it s also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing,2
but see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates,2
it is easy to use good quality and good price,2
its office compatible but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs,2
really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints,2
great product very easy to use and great graphics,2
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum,1
i am not sure if it was the drive itself however,1
get this computer for portability and fast processing,2
very good quality and well made,2
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer when they have a certain promotionoffer going of course,2
i chose the ibookg4 a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone,2
it s so much easier to navigate through the operating system to find files and it runs a lot faster,2
i love the solid machined aluminum frame and the keyboard is the best of any laptop i ve used,2
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming,2
in november my computer messed up entirely and would nt power on after intalling a windows update i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history,0
i continued to take the computer in again and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again,1
just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute but it ran fairly smooth for a nondedicated graphics card,2
needs longer lasting battery more than 1 to 2 hrs,1
battery life could be better but overall for the price and toshiba s reputation for laptops it s great,2
it played various games without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly,2
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a svideo port that would enable one to hook it to a tv,1
i was a little weary at purchasing another 13 macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around,2
i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company,0
i also love the design the looks the feel and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull,2
i upgraded it s ram to 2gb i am very happy with it,2
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused because they knew it was trouble,0
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes,0
while apple s saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products and their support is great it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium,2
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink,1
its nice to have the higherend laptops but this fits my budget and the features i need,2
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop,1
but with a way bigger screen and is able to connect to an hdmi,2
hmmm that high failure rate sure is nt reflected in the retail price,0
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb ram the computer was kinda slow,0
i had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty,0
i still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to,0
there is nothing to complain about the system,1
also the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it,0
a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect,1
it s wonderful for computer gaming,2
many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and can not be downloaded,0
this macbook is an outstanding product with great value,2
the battery holds up well it s built very solidly and runs fast,2
some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software but there is no guarentee,1
or the cursor would show up some place else,1
the other lockup problems are from a myriad of causes the most common being a corrupted version of appleworks which can render the browser useless,0
three weeks after i bought the netbook the screen quit working,0
i had to pay 100 for a universal charger for this cheap 300 laptop,0
the graphics are stunning,2
somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot,0
i m really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer,2
the feature are good enough for what i need,2
this is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine,0
if you really want a bangup system and do nt need to run windows applications go with an apple,1
despite the inconvenient weight i opted for the 12 cell battery,1
you have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability,0
do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop,1
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard,1
the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 laptop does,1
i dislike the weight and size cubersome,0
i bought a logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the mbp but i use the touchpad 90 of the time,1
i use iphoto all the time which is a great program for anyone who is into photography amateurs and experts alike,2
the screen is nt huge but that does nt matter when i output media to the 50 inch lcd tv,1
if you re looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphicsintensive game you d be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market,1
the battery gets so hot it is scary,0
i gave it to my daughter because i just hated the screen hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd s when i wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork,0
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning,0
stopped booting up less than a week after my oneyear warranty was up,1
they improved nothing else such as resolution appearance cooling system graphics card etc,1
also one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells it does nt seem to be a problem,1
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too,0
i preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch,2
awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college,2
you will not be able to talk to an american warranty service is out of country,0
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i ca nt play it because its not compatable with the software,0
so the hard disk capacity really does nt matter to me,1
speakers do nt get that loud but good enough,1
memory is upgradable,2
keyboard good sized and wasy to use,2
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still did nt work,0
i am addicted to photo booth,2
speakers does nt sound that great,0
it runs very quiet too which is a plus,2
i previously purchased a 13 macbook had pro specs and was aluminum style which had a nvidia 9800 if i am not mistaken and it had major heating issues,0
they went through asking me open up various components taking battery out hard disk apart and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it,0
the computer continued to give me issues and in late june it completely died again and i tried to call acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me,0
love the speed especially,2
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive,0
they break down just as often as pcs do and the only reason they do nt get viruses is because no one makes viruses for them they re not better in any way they are worse try finding virus protection programs for a mac they do nt exist,0
1you can not change your desktop background window s 7 starter does not support that function,0
but sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars,1
my kids and dogs destroyed two power cords by pulling on them,0
i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about,2
however my girlfriend realized that the netbook s hinge is a bit loose when you open or close the lcd,1
the laptop was very easy to set up,2
wireless has not been a issue for me like some others have meantioned,1
they sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer they paid postage and whatnot but when i got my computer back it still was nt running right and now my cd drive was nt reading anything,0
now the machine wo nt connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now i m out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought the netbook,0
the next time i had an issue my lightscribe would nt work,0
the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with a droid i have tried both motorola and htc plugged into the usb port,1
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray readwrite drive,1
yes they cost more but they more than make up for it in speed construction quality and longevity,1
i love the dock where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program and the program will simply open that file,2
if internet connectivity is important i would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more or buy a usb wireless card,1
i did have to replace the battery once but that was only a couple months ago and it s been working perfect ever since,2
awesome cooling system much better grafics card ati 5870 8gb ram led backlit screen,2
for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for 2000 off and best buy matched their price so i was able to buy one for under 1000,2
needs power and mouse cable to plug in back instead of side in the way of operating a mouse in small area,1
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed,0
it gets stuck all of the time you use it and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work,0
screen is a bit glossy but that s not too bad,2
but for the cost this is a winner,2
the ease of set up was terrific,2
all in all a very disappointing experience except that i learned how good the geek squad is and also customer service,0
the touch pad is among the best,2
im glad that it has such great features in it,2
the bluetooth was not there at all and the fingerprint reader driver would be there but the software would hang after installation was 12 way done,1
the mouse on the pad the left button always sticks,1
it rarely works and when it does it s incredibly slow,0
until i bought the dell i thought you just looked for what you wanted size software options hardware and purchase the best deal you could find,1
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free even without the warranty,2
the trackpad was easy to learn and navigate,2
the built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus,2
for the same price you get a lot more in the asus 1920x1080 res,1
another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed 175 to send it in to fix it,0
and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself,1
the toshiba net book operates very well,2
which is great i am running vista business and scored a 5x on the index i have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 s,2
only a few days after i received the computer back the screen froze again,0
browsing also was no problem for me when i used itunes which usually slows down my pc,2
the photobooth is a great program it takes very good pictures with the builtin camera,2
i have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production,0
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops but the ease of use security and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag,2
i play a lot of casual games online and the touchpad is very responsive,2
the delivery was fast and i would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again,2
the dvd burner broke after burning 3 dvd d during that time,0
product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan,0
i saw walmart had the same computer for about 650 but still knowing what i know now i would not buy it at that price,0
the only thing is that the battery wo nt last more than 12 an hour,1
ca nt close the 2nd hdd bay since there are brackets you have to break off even then it still does nt shut that could be a major flaw for the dual hdd user,0
great os fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port,2
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have,2
it is easy to navigate and update programs,2
long story short since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one i did nt ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services they finally gave in,0
everything from the design to the os is simple and to the point,2
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer left right and front,1
not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved worked on and opened on both a pc and mac the versions of these programs on a mac are graphically and functionally superior,2
i went to toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it,1
adjust the sensitivity since it s not that responsive to begin with,0
i dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers,0
as well as having the plug in the computer come loose,0
the video card is great for media and above average for gaming but not a gamers first choice,1
lightweight and the screen is beautiful,2
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touchpad making the touchpad hard to use when using headphones mic not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person,0
i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality,2
and if you do a lot of writing editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key,0
overall poor features average performance poor battery life excellent price value poor,0
the paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual,0
the laptop is very lightweight can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight,2
the feel of this is better than the toshiba too,2
it is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame,2
fan noise the fan made a constant hissing noise in the background,1
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage,2
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly,0
i think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it,1
i do transcription work on the side and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well,2
best thing is i can use existing 32 bit old programs,2
as a computer science student in college i find that the portability longevity and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more,2
i liked the aluminum body,2
i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad,2
also the extended warranty was a problem,0
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did nt work,0
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a desktop it does not meet the expectations,0
navigation through the computer is far superior compared to windows operating systems as well,2
good price,2
there are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new macbook,2
i know that asus is known for making motherboards but this is the worst computer experience that i have ever had,0
the newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick but it is still a great notebook,2
now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the mac,2
but it has a major design flaw,0
after numerous attempts of trying including setting the clock in bios setup directly i gave up i am a techie,0
it was a great laptop ran great and was really fast,2
i was nt really as concerned about portability it s a very large laptop but it s not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise,2
once i removed all the software the laptop loads in 1520 seconds,1
if your time is worth anything to you if you are tired of rebooting reformatting reinstalling trying to find drivers if you want a computer to work for you for a change make the change to this computer,1
the battery life also does nt keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack,2
great battery speed display,2
so i paid a visit to lg notebook service center at alexandra road hoping they can make the hinge tighter,1
the internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used and the command prompt would not work at all,0
windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning,0
the fact that you can spend over 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine,2
this computer had exactly the specifications i needed,2
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag,1
so after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer until it froze this morning completely,2
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior,2
easy to carry can be taken anywhere can be hooked up to printers headsets,2
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i ve ever seen,0
pairing it with an iphone is a pure pleasure talk about painless syncing used to take me forever now it s a snap,2
i had upgraded my old macbook to lion so i kind of knew what i was getting but had nt been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multitouch features,2
the price and features more than met my needs,2
my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after 2 days,0
windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service,0
would like more trendy high tech features,2
it s color is even cool,2
returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed except for speaker grill but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all,0
power supply went bad after 2 weeks,0
when typing letters and spaces are frequently omitted requiring the user to redo many words and sentences,0
it is so much easier to use,2
it is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user that makes it run way to slow,0
so what am i supposed to do the lg service center can not provide me the service when it is called the service center,0
i would rate this computer at 5 stars but considering it has a short life span i can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine,0
the processor is very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications,2
also the battery does not last very long at all,0
great pick for portability and affordability,2
the difference in the apple keyboard from a pc s keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to but overall it s worth it,2
it has a 1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive,1
this computer was so challenging to carry and handle,0
other than that i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semidecent gaming capabilities,2
it s still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook,2
graphics are clean and sharp internet interfaces are seamless,2
before i reloaded with windows 7 ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from acer s site,1
again in february my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load windows so i contacted acer to get it fixed thru my warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though none of them spoke english,0
the salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it,0
with all the programs that came with it such as ilife and iwork i was set from the very beginning,1
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i m looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular,2
it is of high quality has a killer gui is extremely stable is highly expandable is bundled with lots of very good applications is easy to use and is absolutely gorgeous,2
i charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life,2
the large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or tv shows on your computer instead of buying an additional tv for your dorm room,2
small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel,2
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid,1
the biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it,0
when you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing,0
well i spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model which gets hot and the battery does nt make it through 1 dvd,0
just a black screen,1
it is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems,2
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it,2
in may i started having problems with the usb ports not working,0
battery life needs more life,1
the battery is irreplaceable,0
i have never really been big on downloading anything so i was nt too worried about getting a virus plus i thought i was protected by norton,0
itunes is a handy musicmanagement program and it is essential for anyone with an ipod,2
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small,0
iphotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos,2
the battery life is great,2
i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great,2
i love the glass touchpad,2
the builtin webcam is great for skype and similar videochat services,2
it runs perfectly,2
as usual at customer service center she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the backoffice and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague i could see them,1
then the hard drive failed,0
sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki,1
of course my warranty runs out next month,1
i m learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages,2
this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet,1
unable to boot up this brand new laptop,0
then it ceased charging at all,0
it might be something deep within windows for i was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive,0
the screen is nice side view angles are pretty good,2
it works fine with our wireless and they ve had not problems,2
you wo nt have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet,0
this is nt a big deal i have nt noticed the issue with dvds or other media only through usb output,1
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck,0
the battery life is amazing the versitility is outstanding,2
there is hardly any memory on the computer s hard drive,1
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components and i m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator but i still expected better product quality for this price range,1
the cover for the dvd drive soon came off too a mark of poor construction quality,0
i can not be happier with the service or product,0
i eventually did the migration from my imac backup disc which uses usb,1
after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace,0
tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk,0
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it,0
the only thing that i have is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters would help if it was a little lighter then it is,1
finally i should note that i took the 2gb ram stick from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time,1
pc users use the powerpoint program for slideshow presentation and mac users utilize keynote,1
after a couple of years my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a companywide recall of my particular battery,0
that s very possible but since they do nt make windows xp drivers for the sound card in this machine i was stuck until windows 7 came out,1
screen keyboard and mouse if you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a mac the beautiful screen responsive island backlit keyboard and fun multitouch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone,2
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent,2
that included the extra sony sonic stage software the speakers and the subwoofer i got that was worth the money the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer the extended life battery and the docking port,2
first it burned or fused the power adapter plug,0
when it come time for warranty service to toshiba you do nt matter,1
without a doubt the design of this laptop is fantastic,2
for the price and what i get out of it has exceeded my expectations,1
if upgrade is possible to the full windows 7 then i will truly be a very happy geek,2
could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out,0
newegg s rma service was great as always i contacted them late friday night and they issued me an rma number and a prepaid ups shipping label the very next morning on saturday,2
screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment,2
they replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board,1
i wiped nearly everything off of it installed openoffice and firefox and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price,2
is this partially due to the fact that it is running windows vista,1
it has plenty of memory lots of hard drive and great graphics,2
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to applecom and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications,2
the video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better,2
the technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother,0
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection,1
applications open in seconds and there are no lags hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea,1
boots up fast and runs great,2
my battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars,0
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit,1
the screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it s very noticeable,0
the battery is really long,0
i do nt understand why only windows 7 starter is included,0
the minute you fire it up it s all good very easy user interface,2
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv,1
the system constantly overheats the battery life is too short the case is coming apart and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly,0
it bluescreened on me without any warning running simply basic chrome,1
it really is perfect for work and play,2
after about a week i finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard,0
hp is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing,0
the screen is gorgeous yummy good,2
i take it everywhere with me because it s so easy to carry,2
3 horrible customer support,0
i have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and fixed the edges by rounding them off,1
otherwise all other features are a 1,1
but after using it a couple of weeks the overall operation is poor,0
the brand of itunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now but keep in mind that apple started it all,1
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the warranty company is horrible,0
great product,2
i have owned many different brands of laptops in my life,1
gave phonenumber,1
ca nt wait until i go on vacation and take it with me,1
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue,1
i made a perfect decision when i bought the toshiba,2
it does nt bother me though,1
it is so speedy,2
in the past four years i ve had it i have never once gotten a virus,1
one of the wonderful things about macs is that they are virus free,2
when i took it back to best buy i asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane,0
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months,0
it turned out it s not really a problem to have a mac,2
this computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and i do mean crawling,0
i bought it to use in college and it is perfect,2
i now travel with this laptop and my work pc,1
hp pavilion dv9000 notebook pc when i first got this computer it really rocked,2
it seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like i thought they would,0
it works,2
in my opinion it was not as user friendly as i expected either,0
hope this helped,2
my friends or children use that when they need to borrow the net when i out grow this meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one and i will be buying only toshiba,1
theres always something wrong with it wether it be some virus you ca nt track down or it overheats sometimes even catches on fire you just ca nt use it,0
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key,2
other thoughts i love newegg i recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable,0
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the 17inch macbook pro,2
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could,2
it s the most wonderful thing in the entire world,2
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet,1
when i started worrying for not hearing anything from them i tried to call,0
but after i got used to it i love it,2
they are nt worth the money even though they are on the cheap side laptop speaking,0
my hp is very heavy,0
in the three years i ve had my macbook pro i have never had a virus on my computer and i do a lot of work on the internet,2
i have had some excellent computer and have found i had no idea what to do with them,2
one of them seems to have worked,2
i paid 800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore,0
and it is impossible to get them back in,0
waited on getting this computer but it has been a great change,2
perfect trifecta,2
i needed a new computer for graduate school had never owned a laptop before and the only reason i did nt purchase a mac was because my school s website strongly recommended students purchase pcs,1
i have had my dell latitude for almost three years,1
it s outstanding too,2
but like i said before the only reason i do nt currently have a mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey,0
i ca nt even turn it off,1
you ll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them,1
they do nt seem to be susceptible to viruses which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers,1
help help other than that gets a great little wonder,2
so far it s an average laptop no better no worse than the hp i replaced,0
i would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage,2
very very disappointed,0
it s so useable and responsive,2
returned it to walmart,1
my hp g60244dx died after only 16 months,0
i love it,2
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me,0
my mac laptop is fabulous in both areas,2
well they do nt care a bunch,0
probably as good as you can get in a netbook does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses,2
everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing,2
bought with a credit card,1
i ll stick to tashiba,1
i dont understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble,0
do nt get me wrong i am no microsoft hater i ve just managed to turn into a much bigger apple fan because of this machine,2
i ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back but the return calls never came,0
i ve had my macbook pro since august 2009,1
i have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that i would have learned a lot quicker if i would have taken the class,2
so you do nt get frustrated the first few weeks,1
honestly i spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what i got on there for,0
so far so good,2
i love the 15 macbook pro,2
i ve saved a lot of time and headaches so far using my new macbook pro,2
both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them,0
so if you move laptop a lot it might get loose however it sits pretty tightly,1
i ve tried going back to xl but there still problems,0
then to make matters worst there is noone that they can transfer you to,0
got it back 3 months later,1
since i never really got to use this i ca nt comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them,0
i was waiting for this model to be released since january and have been holding off on buying a macbook pro until the new model came out,1
stupidly mindnumbingly slow then i found it can only be loaded with 2gb maximum,0
which apple does nt offer is why i bought my macbook at best buy,1
i m excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same,2
please anyone who is considering getting this computer stop,0
it is everything that i would want in a computer,2
this is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone,2
i will never buy refurbished again i do nt cae how cheap it is,0
buy this,1
i love everything about it,2
it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier,2
just what the doctor ordered,1
this has happened three times so far,1
it was just one problem after another for me and that s reason we had forked out so much money was so we would nt have anything to worry about,0
stay away from hp,1
at first when i got this product i loved it,2
this unit is not,0
two owning a 17 inmac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone,2
needless to say not to happy with the product,0
i worked in it retail sales before,1
after 5 months of failed repairs requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and acer is indifferent to the issue,0
this thing is a lemon,0
finally set the unit back to hp after a month of hell,0
my next laptop will also be a mac,2
i ve had the macbook pro 15 for about three weeks and it really is a great computer,2
congratulations asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop,2
another problem,0
for example when my husband turns the light out while i m on the computer,1
it was weird,0
if you need an affordable entrylevel laptop this will fit the bill,2
without having to have extra equipment andor complicated routes to take to be able to do so,1
you will regret it if you buy any dell,0
english must have been his third or fourth language,1
bought from walmart i believe that this laptop was a repaired item,1
but at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem,0
dell latitude d620 is not a reliable machine,0
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus,2
this is not best buy s fault,0
to my mind much more usable than the toy called an ipad,2
do not buy you will be disappointed,0
images can be multiselected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode,1
5 weeks after giving the computer for repairapple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer,1
i want my l505s5988 back,1
i previously owned a toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years,1
i had to have these computers in my school,1
i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat,2
it was shooting sparks,1
i have never had it crash randomly turn off,0
it was always getting froze up,0
right out of the box this little netbook did everything i asked of it including streaming the everyday video you re bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously,1
i do not know for sure,1
i sent it back and they lost it,0
still trying to learn how to use it,1
it is trash,0
i wanted to spend around 700 to 800 so i was directed to a nice looking hp laptop,2
breaks easily,0
i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i wo nt have to worry about a crash,1
i got what i paid for,1
stay away from apple or hope you laptop does not break down,0
enjoy your sitdown,2
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop,1
i never have had a good result with this computer,0
i am now making a point to avoid their products and i hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well,1
i have recommended this laptop to everyone i know who is buying one,2
taking it anywhere was a pain,0
all the problems i have had with pc s are solved with a mac the issue of overheatingmy dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off and the issue of viruses and contaminantsmy hp completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it with no inexpensive way of fixing it,0
toshiba is a great brand even though i have nt had it for a long time i am very happy with it,2
i have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet,2
it want take it it keep saying error,0
i bought this emachines notebook pc in january of this year and i am highly dissatisfied with it,0
my information was all lost my fault i know but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a brand new mac the paragon of all computers,0
i will only buy apple laptops from now on,1
i should have sent it back to them then,1
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused,1
it was old but it was not till we bought the dell did we realize how great it was,2
stay away from envy,1
it s a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs,2
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan,1
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it,2
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back,1
i have owned it only two months,1
this little netboook is helping me get work done,2
did nt expect to repair it at once,0
to those thinking about switching do it and do not look back,1
needless to say a pc that ca nt support a cell phone is less than useless,0
to this day there are none,1
i bought this laptop was the worst laptop i ve ever bought,0
my smart phone is faster,2
i have not have any problems,2
i am a wife mom and a school teacher and a college student,1
much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me,0
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing,2
he came into my house fiddled around on the computer for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it,1
at first,1
the problems started with just the screen freezing,0
i tried out another mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine,2
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling,2
they were great in handling this problem and i m looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future,2
i recommend the macbook pro if you want the best laptop on the market,2
i love the apple products,2
i give up on my data i just want a computer reasonably fast,0
i am a college student and it has been very useful,2
and then a guy came out to serve me instead,1
i think this computer is super lame,0
i also own an hp notebook and it does nt even come close,1
if i have a few hundred dollars to spare i d buy the pro line though the 253 and 266 ghz model,1
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market,1
good luck,2
i have loved this since i took it out of the box,2
i will never purchase a hp again ever,0
this computer was awful i would never recomend it to another person,0
i have had the netbook for 2 months and i love it i read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers i use,2
enough said,1
if so you may be having similar problems,0
would do business again,1
it is a bit heavy,1
it is sleek smooth and lightweight,2
i just love this lap top i just wish it were all silver or they had all black,2
asus said my netbook was working properly,1
plus stylish,2
thanks macconnection for making this a seamless purchase,2
it freezes and it always shows that there is an error so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it,0
i m glad i made the choice to switch and buy this mac,2
my macbook is faster than any comparable pc,2
this computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life,0
they reported that the computer is in their headquarters,1
if you have the money i suggest going for the i7,1
the difference is phenomenal,2
i did not like my acer,0
not super fancy but not super expensive either,1
believe me apple has a reputation,1
so glad i decided to upgrade,2
this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop my wife and i have another laptop or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks,2
i bought this laptop on saturday and am completely in love with it,2
a lot of help they were nt,1
will not buy another toshiba this is my second not happy w either,0
so i got another netbook which i love,2
took the netbook on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop,2
eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on,0
after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses a good friend convinced me it was time to go the apple route,2
while many people brag about mac being intuitive it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a pc but once i got the hang of it i do nt want to go back,1
who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing so i said i wanted a new set,0
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all,1
if you buy pray you dont have major prolems,1
avoid this model,0
good luck with your purchase options,2
i like the laptop overall,2
at least those computers did nt just die on me like this one,0
although my model was listed as recalled hp denied my claim,1
it may take a little getting used to but you do nt have to worry about viruses or other headaches,1
i left the place angrily,0
i could nt afford a new mac so i bought a pc instead,0
obviously we both got new macs,1
i burned my leg after lifting it from my desk and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table so i can place it there,0
everything else just install and go,1
this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised,2
he did nt work for sony he was just approved to fix their crappy products,0
you may be reading one now,1
the latest is on my lg netbook x12,1
you will not regret buying such a great thing like this,2
i can do everything i could before only faster and more efficiently,2
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one,0
i brought this laptop last friday and originally it worked fantastic,2
if it s not shipped on the next business day called on a friday they are closed on weekends what was the next step,0
i m hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross,2
just a bunch of idiots who s english as a 5th language is forced at best,0
if this would be your first mac purchase then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between mac and pc s,2
im very happy with this computer,2
my first laptop was an acer that i got for christmas,1
i should have been more observant,1
so this review might be a tad bit bias,0
it was a tough choice,1
maybe it s acer maybe it s msft,1
but in fact it is totally the opposite,0
i am taking back today,1
i cant believe hp put this out,0
most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be half the time the papers were then erased,0
this computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse,2
it was returned on the third day i owned it,1
still this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work,2
it s also very energy efficient running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 watt lightbulb,2
love it so far,2
i am very happy with this laptop,2
some days it s just blurry some days it appears that it s raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains,1
what s also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time i submitted it in case it does nt keep what i put here are my aratings,1
it s the inside that is truly wonderful,2
i ve had this laptop for about a month now,1
return it,1
and toshiba is totally unconcerned,0
it has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here,1
at first it s like you re in that honeymoon stage with your laptop,1
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro this thing holds its own,2
this is my second macbook,1
i called back to ensure that received it they had,1
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached,0
my kids have to take their pcs in once a year to have them debugged,1
seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the dell,1
i have used a couple of others on the job as well,1
the macbook is a fantastic laptop,2
we now own two of these identical,1
you just lose a customer,0
well i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my pc but took the apple to the conference,1
was a great deal i will give that,2
and it has blue screen crashed on me twice,0
you better believe my next computer will be a mac,2
best buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764,2
one owning a mac is essentially a full production studio in the case of a mac book a portable version,1
the laptop is gorgeous,2
it seems to be incompatible with everything else,0
i purchased this laptop 9 months ago,1
it still serves me well both in business and home needs,2
i can throw anything at it and i do pictures video editing schoolwork,1
my son and his family have a hard time financially because he is selfemployed so the family had no computer of any kind and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school,0
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand,0
first of all i ve been dell fan for more than fifteen years,1
i am definitely sold and not going back to pcs for home use,1
now i could get myself a cheap computer that will probably work a whole lot better,2
i am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it,2
it ca nt get any better,2
i went right out and purchased another laptop,2
i was very excited because this was my first personal computer and i was purchasing it with my own money i had recieved from graduation presents,2
i bought my first macbook after seeing the product demonstrated,2
i do everything on this computer check email facebook shop check blogs write papers listen to music and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv,1
it s just a great toy to have around,2
apparently contactus euroapplecom is not a good address to send complaints,0
page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something,1
2 blue screen first month,1
the perfect notebook,2
winters is on it s way and i imagine it will be cozy,2
dell sucks,0
i am totally satisfied with my little toshie,2
kind of annoying but i still love the laptop,2
it has worked fine,2
could nt keep a page up you were working on,1
this is one of the reasons i purchased it,2
so far a great product,2
after doing cad work all day at work using a higher end pc i could nt come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer,1
it s a mac,1
so far so good with this laptop,2
after looking at all the pros and cons i decided on the macbook pro,2
the macbooks worth every penny,2
that seemed to solve the problem till i wrote an article with semicolons in it,1
i am however pleased that it is still hanging in there,2
they re easy fun powerful and will last a long time,2
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden,1
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase,2
we decided we would try to tradein our old ones,1
1st hand experience is very important especially for a new customer,2
that was my first apple product and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have bought,2
pretty disappointed about this product,0
i ca nt honestly say i was heartbroken,0
took a while to clean it up to my specs,0
hewlett packard hp pavillion dv6000 laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought,0
acer wo nt replace the laptop,1
i took it home and within 30 min it was freezing up and did the blue screen of death,0
i m pleased,2
within 3 weeks the same issues started happening again,0
but i do nt see it as a problem,1
and if u did,1
i hate this one,0
i have owned many computers and laptops,1
this is my second laptop and it is head and shoulders above my first,2
about 12 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash,1
there are so many things wrong with this product it just makes me want to set my self on fire,0
4 weeks after giving the computer for repairannoyed at machouse amsterdam decided to send complaint email to apple,0
the apple macbook pro nothing to say butprofessionally great and outstanding,2
i love this computer,2
the local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some toshiba satellite,1
it is easy to find documents and keep them in one area,2
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon,2
every single one we ve gotten we ve had problems with,0
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black screen for 58 seconds stating pxee61 media test error check cable,0
now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more,2
save your money and go for a better device,2
my favorite by far although the most expensive was my sony,2
she said wal mart rants and raves abouy carring dell because it s a big name but they are a piece of garbage,0
i called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem,0
i do not plan on going back,0
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it,2
will probably never buy a hp again,0
satisfy what i paid for it,1
this is what a laptop is supposed to be,2
back then my entire family was devoted to the sony name,1
it is truly a desktop replacement,2
i m extremely happy with my purchase as i now have the portable power i have been looking for,2
i honestly love my mac thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict,2
the acer one compuer is a great computer,2
but the macbook is the best,2
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once,0
do your research on this issue,1
this system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix,0
do nt waste their money save it and but a mac,1
the benefits were immediate,2
the only time i have restarted is during system updates,1
what a waste of time it was to run a defrag on the pc,0
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place,0
i was so happy with my new mac,2
i ve had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do nt regret buying it,2
i am very happy i bought this mac well worth the extra money,2
i fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now i could not imagine going back to an acer at all,2
this laptop serves all my needs,2
ok first,1
having someone give you a quick tour of how to s is the best,2
have returned that laptop unused,1
they were able to setup with labtops themselves within a few minutes,2
there is a little indent to help open it but good luck with that,2
there are differences that you need to know and take time to learn,1
what can i say,1
better stick with another brand,1
after 4 days being denied 6 times and told off once i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt,1
and i m still paying the bloody financing for a product which did nt last me at least three years,0
i would not recommend this product to anyone,0
i can see why the have soooo much money,0
i bought it for really cheap also and it s amazing,2
i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion,0
it can not save the correct date and time i set,0
i was psyched,2
if you are looking for a good laptop this is not it,0
so do nt get it,1
i returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund,1
i had a toshiba for 10 years,1
i am stuck with a laptop that i can not do very much with,0
well i got this computer from best buy and i have had nothing but problems i bought the computer with a virus,0
love it,2
so if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it,0
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca nt understand what they are saying,0
it has happened again and i m being told that it s 175,0
i am not happy at all with the product i purchased,0
i would definitely not go back to using a pc after using the mac,0
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me,0
which is what i did check out my acer 5517,1
obviously this macbook is perfect for me because it does exactly what i need in an easytofunction way,2
there are a few flaws as well that i noticed,0
i own other macs but always find myself navigation to the macbook pro to get my work done,2
it all just makes sense,2
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers,2
i paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me,0
hp did nt fix it,1
i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months,0
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase,1
good bye blue screen and critical errors,0
simply amazing computer,2
another two weeks later and it was back in my possession,1
and i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop,2
i m all for saving money but dell needs to step it up,1
they will not let you down,1
have purchased many products over the years from macconnection and this transaction like all the others we smoothly with no problems,2
i ve owned every pro model apple laptop for the last 8 years this is by far the worst one i ve ever had,0
very disappointing,0
the awesomest of the awesomest,2
i definatly ca nt,1
i am very pleased with my purchase,2
we purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive hp needed to be repaired,1
unfortunately that is not the case,0
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date,2
well maybe i was just very unlucky,0
i have used pc s and converting to this macbook pro was easy,2
i have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in battle of the smithsonian after on hour mine was at 53 life left and his was at 69 life left,1
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase,1
so if you re thinking of a laptop i would heartily recommend theapple 133 macbook pro notebook computer z0j80001 notebook for all your needs,2
when i got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school i had a hard time from beginning,0
i had to call apple 19 times each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone and take it to their store for evaluations and diagnostics 5 times,1
if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac,1
they told me it was my loss even though it was the computer not what i ve done,0
most of the large bags are for a 17 inch,1
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern,1
cmon lg,1
i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer,1
they say it will take up to two weeks,1
i bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room,2
they are wonderful but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat,0
then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the macbook pro,2
it was nt worth it,0
it is so much fun to play with,2
it was about six months later when the overheating problem started again to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine,0
the apple pro notebook will not let you down,2
i m going back to dell,1
i m very disappointed in dell,0
i also experience the same with my macbook air,1
i was constantly having to roll back the computer after doing updates,0
it is the worst computer dell ever made,0
i will not buy another one,0
my last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new,1
a tip for people looking into this computer do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last,1
the mac book pro performs flawlessly,2
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person,1
the computer is so slow even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up,0
where you click and hold and drag it picture link etc to where you want it,1
i have had laptops in the past and i thought why not give these small netbooks a try,1
its still going,1
my macbook is probably the best investment i have ever made,2
it was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again,1
had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it,0
i was given a mac as a birthday present and could nt be happier with it 3 years later,2
at 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes,1
yet hp wo nt do anything about the problem,0
i m glad it waited this one is great,2
estimated time to fix it 10 working days or less,1
i m new just switched from years of pc frustration,1
also i typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying,0
the latest and mightiest macbook pro 17inch was bought by my university on the 30th of june 2009,2
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it,0
my laptop worked again for just a while before i started having issues again,2
now i guess i ll have to unload my m6809 on some poor hapless soul,0
with all the goodies inside this machine it is a value,2
i love it,2
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air to louisville ky,0
i baby my electronics so i know for a fact it was defective and not anything that i did to it,0
it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click,2
this is the first apple product that i have purchased,2
i believe this is because i was more active than the average user meaning i average about three tabs,2
it would nt fit in most 17inch bags,0
but i would recommend this product,2
it s face and depanable,0
took that one home same thing,1
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses,2
i would never buy a dell again,0
i am just amazed,2
when the computer has been on for several minutes it will occasionaly just go off by itself,1
bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall she has been on it nonstop ever since learning how to use it,2
i did nt like one thing about it,0
overall for the money this is a good deal,2
two times with in one month,1
i investigated netbooks and saw the toshiba nb305n410bl,1
i love this product because it is toshiba and its 156,2
would buy 100 more of these if i could,2
if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus,1
if you could stretch by a few 100 dollars i highly recommend you should replace your windows laptop with this one,2
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling,1
if you are a pc user looking to convert i would highly recommend it,2
i hate to say this but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back then i would,1
and if you are going to deal with hp be careful,1
if you can afford a new laptop and are in the market for one of course then definitely go for this,2
so i m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority,0
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college,1
but not in this case,1
will not every buy another lou,1
for one i noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds,1
macs are designed for the frontal lobe challenged people out there,1
i ordered four d620 laptops,1
my laptop is almost 2yrs old and i have never had any problems with it,2
this mac is great,2
overall though for the money spent it s a great deal,2
i would like to tell you about the best laptop i just got from mac,2
i love it never had a computer i was so impressed with and i ve had a lot of laptops and desktops this one is far and above the best one i ever had before,2
so far so good,2
i saved for this laptop for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait,2
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it,1
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop,0
this is my first personal satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous satellite work issued laptops,2
this a starter notebook,1
this is what they told me it heats up and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops and simply categorize them as portables,1
i would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school,2
so honestly i was nt expecting anything less than perfection and i was nt disappointed,0
i took it to the shop and they said it would cost too much to repair it,0
however a netbook will be a different story,1
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him,2
back she goes,1
we did nt because it was already over 2400 dollars,1
best buy laughed when i told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks,0
but it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future,1
after about another month i had to send it in again to acer for repairs,0
this is a great machine,2
instead of taking another chance on toshiba i went with an asus g73jhx3,1
all the yadayada,1
i previously owned an hp desktop and a dell laptop,1
originally bought it for my wife,1
apple is one of the best computer companies in the country,2
do yourself a favor this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware,0
probably wo nt work either,0
but reasons we chose this apple computer,1
i can do pretty much 75 of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table,1
i can not even read what i am writing half of the time,0
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them,2
i should have kept my big old hp,1
it was over rated,0
would pay more for it if i had too,1
meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis,2
mac computers automatically defrag each time you start your computer,1
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me,2
they removed them and returned the computer to me,1
i think this will happen to any new version of computerphone released and i need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed,1
has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device,1
2nd mac book i have purchased from macconnection,1
i was informed that i need to call some 0900 number first,1
i really do nt like it but i am stuck,0
you may just lose 1 customer for now,0
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems,2
once you go mac you ca nt go back,1
which was way too much money,0
with a healthy pessimism i took the machine home and tried to find a flaw,1
so if you want a good machine that does almost anything this is the one if you want a low budget computer then look at the other great brands best buy sells,2
i am sorry that i purchased this laptop,0
received the product promptly and without any issues,2
i started hainv problems with it within the first month,0
i use my friends and family s 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and hp well i ll never buy or recommend an hp to anyone,2
the lesson learned here is it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible as fast as they can and in this day and age the customer no longer is right all the times,0
being virusresistant is a huge plus,2
if you re looking for a great laptop you ve found the best here,2
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work,2
i only used it to browse the internet and and i dont know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now,0
i was very worried about making the two compatible but literally it was so simple i was almost worried that i was doing something wrong,0
just a month and a half or two months ago my vaio crashed again,0
it would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and i would be up hoursjust because the computer was too slow,0
amazing machine,2
never been hacked,1
sure hope best buy will replace it asap,1
i always swore by pcs and would never consider a mac,0
from the moment i opened the box to the present it has been a great joy,2
sounds like a typewriter but if you can get past that this is a great laptop for a little money,2
this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures,2
it is meant to be portable,1
that day,1
breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 people to report the damaged part will be returned late,0
they told me to reprogram the computer and i did nt need to do that and i lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life,0
the cool thing about the mac book was that i went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iphone then i came back and put them onto my macbook and made a pretty good dvd movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip,2
i like it so much i bought another just for my wife,2
they are not,1
the laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed,0
i definitely will buy a mac again if and when this computer ever fails,2
i ca nt imagine my life without it anymore,1
will certainly use macconnection again,2
so needless to day i m not happy,0
as it turns out i just did nt know any better,0
if anything i would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to,1
again i sent it off to acer by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance,1
i would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one,2
i also bought one for my wife and 3 for my office,1
they re absolutely useless unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall,0
my review mainly talks about the difference i have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro,1
after 3 pleasant weeks of use the laptop just died,0
one bad thing is it gets hot,0
exactly that users,1
i m pretty sure it s not newegg s fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop,1
they informed me that i had around 7 policies or viruses on it,1
i just love my mac,2
this is my 3rd apple laptop and first macbook pro,2
so i d pop them off to see what the problem was well guess what the darn thing would nt go back on,0
not working bad,2
if you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing all craziness may break loose,0
if you are looking for something reliable this is the laptop for you,2
i asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen,1
i did nt want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice,2
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it taped it shut resold it as new,1
but i was wrong,0
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update so if you do nt save your files and information everything will be lost,0
we are addicted to the mac,2
purchased as a gift for a friend,2
thinking about returning it,1
it was a hard decision for me since the macbook pro looked so appealing,2
i should have bought one a long time ago,1
i have a lapdesk which i can use but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic,1
i just bought this laptop 3 days ago,1
i tried turning it done but it did nothing,0
remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product,1
this machine was a horrible experience,0
might not make the avid gamer happy but i do nt really think that is what this computer is designed for,0
this was my first macbook purchase ever,2
the book is useless,0
overall this laptop is great,2
either way the entire thing was just a joke a complete rip off,0
dell is a decently made pc,2
before i bought my new i5 i did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for hp to apple for reliability dependable and long lasting operations,2
i try to use it today and i ca nt logon,1
i looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key,1
definitely recommended,2
mom dad brother sister you name it,1
i use it now more than i even thought i would,2
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever,2
the macbook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic,0
all in all i m incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop and with hp as a whole,0
if you had pc for four years i can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer,0
i m a professional consultant and a client needed work on her machine,1
should be there by the end of the week again,1
i ve never had problems with viruses,1
no good,0
i should have realized that trouble was brewing,0
i ve always used pc s for work home and this is my first experience with a mac,1
i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it,1
i bought it during the recent comex it show,1
problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school,2
the 13 macbook pro is portable durable and very capable,2
quite simply this is the best laptop i have ever owned,2
this is the first macbook i have ever had,2
it is made better thicker and all out tough,2
it s not a recommendation it a plea,1
honestly this is absolutely wonderful,2
do nt waste your money,0
that is how it is able to function better than any other pc,2
finally i purchased a toshiba,1
consumer report recommended toshiba,1
thank god for ctrl z bottom line i ve been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there,2
i do nt really have a complaint,1
they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything,1
recommended to people as their first laptop,1
files as well would become lost deleted or corrupted,0
that is my only complaint,0
so this was great for me,2
i can not even imaging going back to a pc after using this wonderful computer,2
you will fall in love with it in no time,2
very small and portable i ve had this netbook about 12 hrs now and it s better than expected,2
three years is a decent life but this must make it to graduation and beyond,2
what a great little laptop,2
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town,1
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part,2
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run,2
i was wrong,0
that s how frustrating it was,0
i went to my local best buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke,1
if you do nt like fingerprints this might not be the laptop for you,0
i can leave my macbook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it wo nt even be dead,1
despite the plethora of problems i managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years,1
excellent product for the money,2
it is an amazing image and it too is holding up quite nicely to little hands grabbing the back of my laptop,2
the toshiba laptop was a great purchase,2
compresses itself and you ca nt use it,0
i took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one,1
two of the times was in one month,1
other than that i do nt have one complaint in the world,1
got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college,2
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there,2
i was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain flash,0
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a macbook as well,2
so you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item,0
i took the computer into best buy where i purchased it and they kept it over night to study it,1
it is super fast and always loads,2
complied to their protocol called number made case got an email address to send complaint,1
what s really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision,2
while there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down this occurs far less frequently than on pc computers and laptops that i ve used,1
i would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter,0
apparently they re not special anymore,0
do you ever think hp would do that never,0
i ve had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it,2
it has everything you need to get the job done,2
i did a review on it its awesome,2
that s the downside for me,0
it s not like i have used for half a year and then complained about it,0
a couple things you should know,1
dismantle the whole thing then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before,0
sorry toshiba but 1st impressions do count for something,1
never any doubt i would get a macbook just was nt sure which one,1
i have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me,1
ok this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple,2
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site,1
this is my second macbook pro and it s better than ever,2
i was nt really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money,0
unfortunately the laptop i purchased was also a dell and again i have to say i hated it,0
this is basically the best laptop i have ever had or used,2
from the start when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine,1
this computer is absolutely amazing,2
so i called again,1
i think just going from pc to mac has gotten me totally spoiled and i ca nt imagine ever going back,0
however they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge,2
my brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an apple,1
no laptop is perfect but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you,2
the advantages of owning a mac are numerous,2
this has been nothing but a headache since we purchased it,0
99 to fix it,1
it lasted for many years of travel kids and abuse and if i fired it up today it would work,1
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it,1
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one,1
she told me flatly it s like that one,1
that s a huge difference,2
i ca nt imagine ever buying a pc again,0
i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop,1
i m glad i bought this laptop it was worth the few 100 extra dollars,2
i purchased two laptops for my husband and 16 year old daughter,1
for the use it was purchased for it is a good laptop,2
sorry newegg,1
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get mac,1
so buyers beware,1
such as pages numbers and so on,1
i will never again buy another acer not will i buy gateway or emachine as they are all from the same company,0
recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me,0
even set at the highest level the computer sacrifices its queen every time,0
i found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at best buy which was a great deal,2
i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst,0
it out performs any other laptop on the market today,2
returned it,1
its a dog plain and simple,0
3 weeks after giving the computer for repairvisited machouse amsterdam,1
after the first few months the computer started crashing about every week,0
worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment,2
being a pc user my whole life,1
in fact he said about 10 of their products fail,0
all of them were windows machines,1
update two years after buying this laptop i am now the proud owner of a lemon,2
they would repair one thing send it back and it would still have the same problem,0
i upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop,2
in summary take your money elsewhere,0
i believe i purchased this in dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 510 hours a day 46 days a week,1
i would never tell anyone to buy one either,0
buy this if you like being tortured teased frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old mac,0
looking to take my video and photo editing to the next level i decided to purchase the mbp 15in intel core i5 after reading consumer reviews as well as professional reviews of this laptop,2
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening,0
my computer was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates,2
this is a great computer,2
this laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery i have owned outside of the iphone,2
i really wish i had done this years ago,1
i was starting to boil,1
after years of using pcs a new mac user is basically forced to relearn how to use a computer,0
during that time i had to send it back 3 times,1
i really wanted a mac over a pc because i used a mac in high school,2
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing,1
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it,2
i have had several machines over the years both for personal and business use,1
this laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials,2
went silently,1
that was a big mistake,0
i do nt like this company nor the toshiba brand and i ll never buy another one because i ve put more into it then it is worth,0
my children wo nt even use it for their school work,0
i loved it,2
what a waste,0
let me start with the good so awesome,2
i claim that this has no value to me the laptop was new anyway,0
most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on,0
i m now trying to decide on another dell model,1
returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable,0
i spent 2200 dollars on a top of the line laptop,0
those things are very important vital even,2
so i must say i am not a happy camper,0
we do nt mind and you do nt matter,1
however if i sound enthusiastic about this i am,2
it does nt heat up like my old laptop,1
i have had at least eight toshiba laptops and they have been outstanding including this one,2
i had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly,0
second it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated,0
i went with him and we picked this one,1
the toshiba mini notebook model nb 305n410bl is a great little computer,2
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this never happen,0
i am glad i did my research,2
i ca nt say enough good for it,1
it has had some problems,0
these new problems were the final straws,0
apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days i send them the old computer,1
she brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that it is like that one,1
i bought mine from apple store the day it was released as amazon did nt have it yet,1
now they are believers in the product,1
i spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare,0
in short i would never buy a compaq again,0
before i got my macbook i owned a dell laptop,1
seriously why have nt they just replaced it by now,0
the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once it never slows down,2
using this machine is like a mild form of torture,0
i dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing,0
i bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his christmas present,2
if the number of patrons in the apple store are any indication hp and other pc manufacturers need to take note,1
this is my first computer purchase,1
great overall,2
just for a stupid cd,0
so it was only about 2 weeks ago,1
i would have to say that overall its great,2
i hate it,0
returning this as soon as i get out of work,1
it is the worst laptop ever,0
i have been a mac user since the mid 90s,1
managed to send complaint email,1
not good for a person who gets online daily,0
i really like the mac 154in notebook but its very pricey,2
maybe not the cutting edge satellite l455d but it is a workhorse,1
i like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races,2
i bought them for my college age grandchildren and these macs are totally reliable and support their class work 100 of the time,2
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem,0
its not bad just very very annoying,0
bought the first asus laptop in san francisco returned it in santa maria thinking it was just a problem with that computer,1
highly recommend for daily use,2
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test and it was failing,0
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 25 hrs out of it,1
because it is a defective product,0
otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations,2
its sad because their commercials are great,0
i will never buy another hp computer,0
all the customers that come in hate dell,0
we have nt had any problems with it at all,1
my sister is the electronics manager at wal mart and she says that hp is the best,2
falls into the case,1
still pretty pricey but i ve been putting off money for a while as a little macbook fund and finally got to use it,1
i had finally reached my limit and broke down,0
sad very sad,0
i ve had my macbook pro for three years now and still love it,2
now am very aprehensive about toshiba laptops,0
the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable,0
it has everything i would need for a home computer,2
i got it for christmas and i was so excited to set it up,2
i have had my macbook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that i will never buy another computer if it is not a mac,1
she tells me about it all the time but i tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going,0
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars,1
mac is extremely different than any other laptop,1
summary after doing some investigation on the web i have found that toshiba nb205s are not chronically not booting,1
however i dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then i have ever had with anything,0
just do nt waste your time and money on this,0
the computer was delivered as promised,2
they ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months,1
i highly recommend this product,2
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it,2
my iphone synced right up just like a person would expect unlike the pcs in our lives,2
dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime i called them with a problem,0
note that i do nt ordinarily take the time to write a review,1
no viruses,1
and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully,2
summary dont buy hp,1
sony acer dell packard bell and toshiba,1
this computer is the ideal college companion,2
everything is falling apart internally and externally,0
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express,2
there is no way i will buy a lg product in the future,0
i am very happy,2
my wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine and any connections i turn on should work,2
i just recently had to ship my laptop back to hp for repair,0
this comes in very handy for me as an educator,2
but enough about that i am an apple convert for life,1
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 s,1
the machine itself is alright,2
this is my first lg product,1
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke,0
they freeze all the time,1
it s fun to take to a bookstore sit in the coffee shop area sign in to wifi and look up book reviews of books i might buy,2
all i can say is wow,2
i am loyal to apple,2
i got this laptop on black friday,1
so far i have no complaints,2
i ca nt begin to say how disappointed i am,0
i got the macbook and he got a macbook pro,2
oh it is such a great piece of equipment,2
shiny this laptop is the best of the best,2
this laptop leaves alot to be desired i have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice,0
i hate it,0
while it was barely a bargin in the begining i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others,0
tosiba has a good reputation my llast computer was an acer,2
i still see the benefits of a pc when i do not know how to do something on my mac,1
i would recommend this product,2
if only bill gates would read some of what is said here ms would do a better job,1
i fell in love with it,2
the notebook pc toshiba qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me,2
i could have purchased a cheap computer to do what i m doing now,1
although i was promised about 10 hours i found myself to a limited 7 hours which is still amazing,2
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself with help of friends and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it,0
i bought a hp pavilion dv41222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer,0
this laptop does everything i need it to very well,2
the apple mc371lla 24ghz 154inch macbook pro notebook is a horrible waste of money,0
the newer macbook that i have purchased is one of the best computers,2
i waited and waited and no laptop,0
it is just slow slow slow,0
of course emachines can not be made entirely to blame for this computer s woes,0
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner,2
the great 18 month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills,1
only to get another hpcompaq piece of crap,0
i use that alot on my desktop so i am adjusting to not having it,1
that s right no power absolutely nothing,0
i love ths notebook,2
stay away from machouse amsterdam,1
my mac is much more efficient than a pc so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete,2
they are closed at 9pm eastern,1
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel,1
my wife recently purchased an apple macbook pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday,2
when calling dell for help reurn or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it,0
i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for 3 months,1
really no problems with the hand me down computers i received from my children,1
now i know,1
this computer gets very hot before shutting down,1
eventually we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the machine that was causing the problems,0
steve jobs probably needs help and donations and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby,0
it s solid,2
for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened 7 months ago they offered me an itouch 8gig you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich offer a loyal customer like me a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this,1
overall i am very satisfied with the purchase,2
it is the easiest computer i have ever used,2
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful,1
i go to purchase it on line and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later,0
bought it to use mostly for oline classes,1
its more like a snail crawl,1
it was a great deal after all,2
lord have mercy,1
buy it love it and i promise you wo nt regret it,2
other thoughts received replacement 16 days later,1
big mistake,0
this is my second mac book pro,2
ive owned apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember,1
needs constant repair,1
it was a waste of money from day one,0
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot,0
this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny,2
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me,2
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in,1
oh my goodnessi am not a happy camper,0
thank you for your great product,2
i love how easy every thing is to do on my apple products,2
i m going to try and keep my old g4 on the road for as long as possible,1
the only pro to this computer is it was under 600,2
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one,1
it s a joke,1
i am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review,0
but if you are in the computer field you probably would nt be here,1
this was around three years maybe four years ago,1
best buy rocks,2
this one has had the same effect,1
the first one i had was a 2006 model not the pro,1
for those old enough to remember it is similar to beta versus vhs,1
either way i m furious,0
so not having my laptop was discouraging,0
this netbook went bad on me after 3 days,0
emachines says they re waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit,0
finally i could nt take it anymore and ordered my apple,0
hieroglyphics are quite common,1
i sit down and use my husband s work pc and i do nt like it one bit,0
with in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down,1
but mac makes the switch from pc to mac easy,2
i love my macbook pro,2
please make these,1
let me tell you this machine is great,2
as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy,1
i now own another hewlitt packard,1
hopefully amazon will take this back,2
i own a hewlett packard laptop and i ve had man problems with it since i bought in in feb 201,0
i droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and it is still working with no issues,2
however this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it,0
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems,2
more relieved than anything,2
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises,1
if you already own a 2009 2010 or early 2011 model you should wait until the next update,1
buyers beware,1
i had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer,1
this thing sucks,0
couldnt not use it,0
easy learning curve,2
he gave me this pc about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it,1
so how can you solve it cmon i just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago,1
5 months dead again,0
from the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer,2
i do find that my macbook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal pc especially if you enjoy technology downloading pictures and graphic design,2
the computer is a dream come true,2
it s slow and one day i hope to have the money to get rid of it and buy something else,1
i got the first blue screen of death in the early part of july,1
apple and quess what you have to send the whole laptop in too bad so sad,0
that being said it still runs video in full screen decently,2
no more lenovo for me,1
it has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on,0
this laptop has left me with a horrible taste in my mouth for acer brand products,0
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up,1
i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one but imo no stars,1
by air sounds more like by truck to me,1
we were occasional mac users before but most recently owned a budget pc since it is what we could afford,2
it was a total dhell experience that i will never repeat,0
the new macbook pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing,2
i like it better than my big dell laptop,2
i shipped out on saturday july 17,1
it is extremely user friendly and intuitive,2
great quick laptop for the money,2
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting a new laptop to replace my twomonth old laptop,2
it makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze and organizing them by place time taken or sending them to an online print shop or uploading them to flickr or facebook etc is not hard at all,2
does a great job with video shot on a canon 5d mkii,2
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one,0
for me five stars is not enough,0
posted nov 8 2010 two weeks ago i bought this notebook,1
i m so glad i purchased a mac and not another pc,2
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am,0
very happy,2
there is nothing better,2
i pondered very long over this decision,1
got another 1 and same issue,0
i ll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba,0
i have now had it for 15 months and love it,2
i will never buy anything from hp again,0
i ve already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye d the computer when i took it out of my bag,1
the ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it,1
i have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is awsome,1
buyer beware,1
let s just get this out of the way i love apple,2
also you wo nt have to worry about them going onlne a getting a virus,1
i was so excited to receive the toshiba l455 as a giftbonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine,2
i hate it,0
was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba probably not ever again,0
i bought this netbook for traveling and it s great light functional and meets my needs,2
i m definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence,1
not the day received,0
might have to buy one for me now since i use it all the time,1
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again,1
yes i have it on the highest available setting,2
if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal,2
i had less problems,1
i enjoy very much my new toshiba purchased specifially for attending online schooling,2
our apple 133 macbook pro notebook computer z0j80001 notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking,2
i was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday,2
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box,1
i would highly recommend this macbook,2
i m not going to lie i ve never really liked the acer brand in general,0
it is not even a year old yet so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone,0
you may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick,0
i would never go back any more i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone,2
it is so great i can hardly ever take my hands off it,2
bottom line i doubt you d be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine,0
i decided i wanted a laptop so i went into the bby store,1
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it,0
would highly recommend this netbook though,2
everything was so easy,2
i have had two toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay they are in no way comparable to the mac,1
anyone who is considering buying an acer computer of any sort i seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand,1
the computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it,0
i love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it,2
i could not handle it one hand like i can the replacement computer i purchased,0
on two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969,1
by the way teachers they offer a discount which helps,2
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 23 days for turnaround time,0
i bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around,2
clearly there is something wrong with the product and lg did nt take up the responsibility,0
it s more expensive but well worth it in the long run,2
i ll wait and save up for a new one,1
no machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems,0
it does nt have a lot of frills but i did nt need any and being able to buy what i needed and not more than i needed was very important,2
they definitely have a superior product,2
though you get a polite person you often don t get a solution,1
after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq,0
my husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about 300 less he got a pc,1
no problems no lock ups no disappointments,1
i recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it,2
to list a few they tend to get hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns as well as ignite any flamable material if near the part that happens to heat up,0
i have recently converted back to a mac and i could nt be happier,2
i ve been a pc user and i just finally switched and i am never going back,0
do not buy it,0
currently if i use the laptop i ca nt sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs,0
a little pricey but it is well well worth it,2
it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access,2
also i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot and not even sitting on anything to make it hot,0
i purchased an hp right after my high school graduation,1
also it is light weight compared to others,1
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage,0
it easily fits into most computer bags but does nt weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals andor textbooks,2
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv78 in nov of 09,1
i do nt have that additional money right now and therefore would nt have purchased it at this time,1
i will have to say that i love my macbook pro,2
we purchase the dell xps several years ago for my home business,1
many thanks overstockcom,2
otherwise i love it,2
i asked many people search on the net and also read reviews here in best buy,1
well i bought this laptop a month or two ago,1
and finally i realized that mac is the best,2
after paying over 1000 for this computer it was not worth it,0
i have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied,2
i was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks,0
good laptop for the money,2
i have full control at all times of what is going on there is no controlaltdelete business anymore,1
heck i like all mac computers but they re all way too pricey for the kind of economy the us is going through,0
as of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom about 4 inches across is hardly visible,1
time will tell,1
when i am at starbucks between clients i get full bars on my hp and 1 bar on my eee pc,1
they have not sent a new one nor called,1
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter,0
i m very happy with this machine,2
with what i paid for this computer it should have had everything on it,1
they lost my laptop for a month,0
overall this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase,2
luckily dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one but instead i got a refund and bought a mac,1
for 2 months,1
this laptop was bad from the first day of use brought it back to store for return of money,0
after much battling with hp i was able to return it 4 times for repairs,1
i took it back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one,2
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy,1
called machouse amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement no answer,1
taking notes research an online class and such and did nt want to spend too much on my first machine,1
not a bad laptop it s a bit slow but gets the job done,2
by this time i was regretting ever seeing this machine on the shelf,0
they click,1
my macbook was worth after 3 years of use 375,2
do not purchase this laptop,0
i love it,2
i ve had friends with acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems,1
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town lots of people little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector etc,1
it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me,2
took it back as it was defective,0
but as time went on i found it almost impossible to keep the thing online through wifi,0
you will love this macbook if you choose to buy it,2
i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer,1
i had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town,1
very fast and efficient,2
this is another reason to like the mac,2
if you are a person like me more on the creative side the mac has something for you too,2
it is however very heavy,1
and toshiba is a quality supplier,2
look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while i cook,1
the hewitt packard pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop before this i had a dell desktop that i loved,2
when this happened i would have to completely power off my computer and restart it,0
i do nt do any high tech stuff on it just write papers check mail and sometimes play games so i ca nt reccomend it if you are in the computer field,1
you might think i am new in this game but i am a gadget lover and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years and none gets this hot that fast,2
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it s like new i might have 8 months next time,1
being only 2 months old i am not a happy camper,0
i ve been having endless problems since i bought the computer only 1 month ago,0
having had experience with a toshiba laptop i was disappointed to find that the toshiba nb305 laptop has major problems,0
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with,2
i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go,2
no i am generous calling it slow,1
he ca nt stand it,0
5 cut my losses and sold it for parts,1
money and time well spent,2
do you think the shop will give me a new set it will not,1
she ca nt tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system,1
hp refused to give me a new one and wal mart refused to take it back,0
probbly the worst decision we ever made,0
i would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend,2
and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour,0
i bought for my son in the 2nd grade,1
i think it was seventy nine plus tax,1
the dell mini was the first dell product that i had ever purchased,1
i have the a65 right now it s a paperweight,1
it is held in place magnetically,1
in the past few years i ve had terrible experiences with hp,0
other thoughts do not purchase this product,0
i am a full mac convert now,1
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one,2
my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary,0
best buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer,0
while the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geekspeak there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the pc world,0
this computer is really fast and i m shocked as to how easy it is to get used to,2
allinall i would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone,2
almost 4 years ago i bought what was then the current up to date hp pavilion if i recall correctly it was the dv 1300 t,1
this is starting off good,2
i made the right decision,2
i am going to go back and return at store i bought from,1
guess i ll stay away from hp,1
both my husband and i have this model toshiba,1
i loved it then but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet,0
it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required,1
each time taking about 1 day or so,1
i do not recommend this company or their products,0
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware gaming machine,2
i d recommend this laptop to anyone,2
what an elegant wonderful machine,2
if i have a problem with any of my apple items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there,1
i am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one,2
it turns out that this hp pc had been preciously sold by wal mart,1
now 17 months later they want would not say exact amount 16500 to 400 to fix the machine,1
i already own an iphone and so the move just made more sense,2
i have never had an experience like this,0
few viruses to catch,1
this laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases,0
this laptop rocks only wish it could run solidworks cad which apple does nt support,2
it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all,2
hope this helps,2
it s catatonic,0
it was definelty a smart move,2
bought this gateway m50 or 150 early 2007,1
bought notebook 072009,1
i complain again,0
i ca nt even install one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print,0
this machine rocks,2
3dmark6 score is only 8500,1
after they found no other way they told me to courier it to them since they do nt allow the use of the post office at my expense and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would nt be covered,0
it has a overheating issue nearly to the point of being dangerous,0
i love this 13 mac white unibody,2
i m very impressed,2
the computer did what it was not supposed to do and i did nt know what to do,0
i ve always owned a pc and decided to try a macbook to see what it s all about,1
the first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it,0
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase,1
if you find yourself in the market for a new laptop and have the money do nt exclude looking at the mbps,1
my macbook pro is no exception,2
when i got it i immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive,0
i have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed,0
i practically have a new laptop with all the fixes they have done,2
i would recommend not buying this product,0
unless you do nt care how long it takes to get going find something else,0
i m returning mine,1
numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until i got the blue screen of death and had to send the pc back to hp,0
no viruses,1
my parents bought it for me as a graduation gift and i m totally almost kind of maybe definitely obsessed with it,2
the 1 reason that is always repeated,1
great food and the prices are very reasonable,2
great staff,2
as i made the title it s an affordable restaurant for great taste,2
the wine list is excellent,2
i have nt eat a lamb chop as delicious as that the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil,2
the service was excellent friendly and attentive,2
the staff offers impeccable service,2
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork,2
the music does get a little loud at times but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife and as i did i got a whiff of corriander,2
best taiwanese food in ny,2
disappointing food lousy service,0
really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though,2
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm but the open kitchen is part of the charm,2
prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant,0
we ate here in march 2006 and ordered the pretheatre 3course dinner with wine flight,1
the food was authentic,2
no more reservations expensive tips and annoying stuff,0
plus they made a perfect martini,2
when he s not making authentic neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms he s visiting the regulars a growing legion and checking on newcomers,1
if you like the food and the value you get from some of chinatown restaurants this is not the place for you,0
three page wine menu one page entree and horedevous,1
the sushi has been from average to below average the wait service has always been subpar the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen the acousitcs are horrid everything echoes is extremely loud,0
there was a small wait but shorter than i expected,1
this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls,2
first the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials which i would have chosen had i known about them,1
you must try the shrimp appetizers,2
the atmosphere is much better than sripraphai more modern and sleek,2
good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off like in this case,2
we arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past but that s just it the past,1
they forgot a sandwich did nt include plastic forks and did nt include pita with the hummus platter,0
consequently their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they didnt feel like finishing them,0
there is no excuse for such lousy service,0
quality ingredients preparation all around and a very fair price for nyc,2
the service was a bit slow but they were very friendly,2
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited,2
great food spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom,2
and i have eaten my share which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve,2
great wine list reasonably priced sara,2
a the service was good to excellent along with the attitude,2
regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you five minutes,1
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever,0
if you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service this is the place,2
my wife and i always enjoy the young not always well trained but nevertheless friendly staff all of whom have a story,2
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo,1
the place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints and has a bar which deserves a mention,2
the food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down,2
not only was the food outstanding but the little perks were great,2
their margarita is best i ve had since i ve returned from naples,2
as there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats except at taj mahal,1
waiters are slow but sweet,2
the bruschetta and panini s are so yummy,2
we always get a sampling of appetizers and share,1
the dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it,1
salads were fantastic,2
we could not catch our waiter s eye and he ignored us,0
my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque,2
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi,1
i found the food service and value exceptional everytime i have been there,2
while this is nt classical restaurant fare the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burnouts,2
we were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria but facing away from the bar when we turned back around the 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it,1
truly the mark of an attentive waiter,1
so i ve never actually been to m proper but i ve had it delivered a few times,1
i was nt thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes but i guess that s the price you pay for a popular place,0
the food now is inconsistent,0
we wo nt go to this place again for a good meal,2
i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service,2
from the appetizers we ate the dim sum and other variety of foods it was impossible to criticize the food,1
waitstaff are very friendly,2
i ve rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years i ve been going,1
the bread and lamb chops i had before the meal were quite good however,2
my picks guizhou chicken fish with hot bean source fish fillet in spicy source special menu,1
i ve been to naples 45 for dinner twice,1
i m partial to the gnocchi,1
i always get the shabushabu dinner and the beef is always fresh,2
i plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta panini s,2
the fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary,2
unfortunately the food is outstanding but everything else about this restaurant is the pits,0
it may be a bit packed on weekends but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area,2
drinks got screwed up she acted put upon,0
if you love seafood you would love this place,2
i have been there many times and food is good and consistent,2
that is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste,0
i like the somosas chai and the chole but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing,0
if you re looking for perfect traditional sushi go here if you re looking for interesting combinations try sushi of gari s east side,2
the steak was excellent and one of the best i have had i tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat,2
when my husband and go there we spend 6000 have lobster tails ummmmm need i say more i ca nt say any more it a place you ll never forget if you never go you ll miss a meal of your life time,2
while this can hardly be called a restaurant it is possibly the best deal in manhatten 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 23 entrees,2
the dim sum is ok but does nt taste that fresh and the little dishes do nt look steamy hot as they should also note lack of chinese here,0
no food snobs allowed this place is for people who appreciate good food,2
do not get the go go hamburgers no matter what the reviews say,0
we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai,0
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza,2
not a small feat for good french food in the area,2
the worst excuse for japanese food i ve ever encountered,0
the allitalian staff is warm and engaging from the start,2
try the mediterranean salad it is a true experience for your taste buds,2
the restuarant itself is not large but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic taiwanese,1
the garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city,2
everything is excellent the menu is quite extensive and you eat with a view on both sides of the city,2
considering their price of 625 for lunch special the dish was ridiculously small,0
good french restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you re into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at katz deli or mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants,1
and i would have to agree with the masses in terms of service delivery is their achilles heel,1
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids,1
the soup is pretty good too,2
the space is a bit too small for live music so on jazz nights it can be loud and cramped,0
great wine great food,2
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese gets a little messy,0
he not only makes his own homemade mozzarella but every pie is ultra fresh,2
and kruno the beverage manager is the best bartender i have yet to come across,2
all the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews,2
great selection of wine and seafood,2
we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun dessert recommended by the waiter,2
as soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out,1
the only disappointment was the coat check girls who did nt seem to know what a customer is on a realtively nonbusy night for the coat check girls,0
small servings for main entree i had salmon wasnt impressed girlfriend had chicken it was good,2
the portions are now very small the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good the restaurant due to its popularity seems frantic,2
tuk tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price,2
one of us actually liked the expresso that s it,2
the ceiling is amazing,2
however service was as plain as sesame crusted salmon i had,1
all the nyu students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere,2
also the sandwiches nearing 7 did nt come with anything like chips or a side,1
some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers other times they ve skipped my order,0
acceptable prices,1
slightly above average wines start at 70 with only one selection listed at 30,1
sure the setting is nice,2
for the quality of food a little too expensive,0
however i think this place is a good hang out spot,2
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great,2
another plus is most of the entrees are approx,2
the staff is no nonsense,1
in reality to maximize potential diners they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby,1
i can not imagine better indian food in all of the city,2
they might be all business at the counter when you give your order but their food says i love you,2
also do nt plan on asking for your favorite roll if it s not on the menu you ca nt have it,1
if you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here,1
it took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses,1
the service is descent even when this small place is packed,1
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates,2
i asked for seltzer with lime no ice,1
when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else,2
service here was great food was fantastic,2
never in my life did i think that i could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for 300 in nyc,1
the quantity is also very good you will come out satisfied,2
of course this atmosphere is lacking but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways,0
great roofdeck nice group of 30 somethings but no music kind of quiet,2
the food was delicious i had a halibut special my husband had steak and the service was topnotch,2
food and service was okay,2
the food is fresh delicious and reasonably priced,2
the wait staff is very friendly if not overly efficient,2
my husband said he could ve eaten several more the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had,2
we ve been to grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed,0
nicky the nose at the bar is a treat,2
furthermore the rice had no seasoning so the sushi was bland and disgusting,0
you ca nt say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown,1
yeah sometimes the service can be slow,0
the food was amazing the service was so attentive and personable and how about that ambience,2
nice ambiance nice little bar good bartender francois and good service,2
but they ve done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the godmother pizza a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oilbrushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual,2
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening,2
immediately after we paid the waiter took the money and said okay you guys are outta here,1
horrible food and horrible service,0
whem asked we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were,1
we have been to this place many times and always have great food wine and service,2
here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid,1
a glass of leaping lizard a glass of prosecco and the mussels had everything happy,2
the menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them,2
we ve never had any problems with the staff but maybe we ve been lucky,2
both are very reasonably priced around 8 for dinner and 5 for lunch and are delicious and filling,2
threw my fiance s surprise 30th birthday dinner here could nt be happier,2
the food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices,2
oh but wait we were out of drinks which were also delightfully overpriced,0
since it literally is a complete hole in the wall it s a bit intimidating at first but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you do nt hesitate to ask for help with what to get,2
it looked like shredded cheese partly done still in strips,1
what generous portions,1
warm comfortable surroundings nice appointments witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms,2
outstanding bagels but you get what you pay for,2
the sides were ok and incredibly salty,1
while the menu is nt especially groundbreaking everything i ve tried so far has been wellexecuted and tasty,2
it s just ok pizza,1
but the coconut rice was good,2
