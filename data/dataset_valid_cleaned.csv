the pizza was really good
knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average
the service was ok
i'm happy to have nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting
indoor was very cozy and cute
ballato's is consistently delicious authentic italian food
while the room is not particularly comfortable once you're seated you'll forget about everything except what's on your plate
the dim sum however was very good
we have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip and the food was delivered quickly but we live only a few minutes walk from them
spreads and toppings are great though a bit pricey
i've eaten thai many times and am very familiar with the cuisine
the food is authentic italian delicious
i recently went to this restaurant with some coworkers for lunch and had an amazing time
it's constantly open catering to the pakistani cabbies lined up on crosby st so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect ie surprisingly fresh
great vibe lots of people
the cuisine from what i've gathered is authentic taiwanese though its very different from what i've been accustomed to in taipei
always a nice crowd but never loud
besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served and that order was undercooked and charged 45 more than we should have been on our bill
the bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that i will never go back
the strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds
the chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites
the restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly
at taj vegetarians can rejoiceall the dishes are manna from heaven
kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them
fish is so very fresh
the lobster sandwich is 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price
largest and freshest pieces of sushi and delicious
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna
the environment is romantic but the food is horrible the service is pathetic and gabriella lies about everything she could
this is the perfect date spot for williamsburg couples
if i could rate the people this place would be off the charts unfortunately the pizza sorry not the best in nyc
the lamb meat was undercooked and extrmely chewy
the pesto pizza was excellent thincrust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that i'd never heard of before
the inhouse lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music and moreover takes requests
they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine so if you want to make a reservation you are limited
so all i'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant i've ever been to
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish
the bruscetta is a bit soggy but the salads were fresh included a nice mix of greens not iceberg all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen
and at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water
if you're not familiar with the cuisine you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards
it is what modern cuisine is all about
in fact two people could really share one plate
very excited to hear that shortterm chef jason narone has moved on he truly was a low point of their sterling track record
all the money went into the interior decoration none of it went to the chefs
besides when you have bad service that's less money you have to tip
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make'em worth eating
so a little inconsistency there but either way both pizzas were really good
it costs 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an insideout roll but the roll more than triples in size and that's not just from the rice
pizza was a little soggy
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york
we began with the cheese fondue the artisanal blend and added apples and kielbasa to dip
the service was attentive yet unimposing the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced
this is such a lovely peaceful place to eat outside
the quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10
ambience is delightful service impeccable
the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc
the waiter was attentive
late nite omelletes are not good here there is no variety
the entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner
for those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more
and they provided a delicious dessert on the house
do n't go alone even two people is n't enough for the whole experience with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods
having discovered ping's on the internet we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in
great value for the quality ingredients
the bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher 2 for 1's
fish was overdone
monday nights are a bargain at the 28 prix fix this includes a three course meal plus three glasses of wine paired with each course
the kitchen however is almost always slow
terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes
great friendly service fast seating fast delivery excellent sushi
i have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect on a date with my husband with my mom with girlfriends and larger groups
the atmosphere is great
i live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of the pizza place at 3am
food is great and inexpensive
my husband and i enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full
great pizza and fantastic service
ambiance and music funky which i enjoy
we were a group of 8 and well seved
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted
our favorite meal is a pesto pizza the house salad and a good bottle of wine
i highly recommend cafe st bart's for their food the ambience and wonderful service
decor is charming
saturday nov 6th i had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us
great sushi experience
a great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from costco and sell it right outside for only 250
best dish is noriwrapped tuna
and the food was fantastic
i like mamoun's food as well but side by side kati rolls just produce tastier food hands down
even upon delivery their juicy pork buns are quite good
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine if you can call 7000 inexpensive the cost is through the roof for better than average fare
i was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer
but the thing that my wife and i hated was it was so loud and it felt like' bar' or' pub'
as much as i like the food there i ca n't bring myself to go back
the staff are attentive and have smiles on their faces
from the entrees to the sides to the drinks everything was creatively prepared yet still simple
emilio the owner is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go
after dealing with subpar pizza all over the kensington neighborhood i've found little toninos
the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group
while the food was excellent it was n't cheap though not extremely expensive either
we were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available
it was nice and fresh but i ca n't give it high scores on being authentic thai
the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious
why do people rave about the ambience
i went at 600 pm specifically for the pretheater menu 1995 for roasted tomato soup with chevre steak frites creme brulee and it was marvelous
the waiters are sweet the food is tasty and the bill is never too large
the food is usually good but it certainly is n't a relaxing place to go
i'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food
ambiance relaxed and stylish
your money could easily be better spent elsewhere anywhere
it wo n't break the bank but i also wouldnt come back for the food
because of the delicate thin crust takeout pies get soggy in their boxes
over price and small portions
i had the cod with paella spicy and very filling i'm a big eater and could only eat half while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips again a big serving at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries
their sake list was extensive but we were looking for purple haze which was n't listed but made for us upon request
i really enjoyed the shows put on by the actors
the pizza was pretty good and huge
be careful of portions they're huge
the hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else
the food is expensive but worth every bite
there is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times
perhaps this food is considered extreme to an upper east side resident but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food this is simply dull
all of my coworkers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they had n't heard about this place
the decor is vibrant and eyepleasing with several semiprivate boths on the right side of the dining hall which are great for a date
oh yes and they lie on the phone claiming they have seating in the garden then of course the seats are not available
i have to say i have never had a disapointing meal here
those rolls were big but not good and sashimi was n't fresh
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta raddichio was kind of bitter though
service was excellent and the ac worked very well too thank god it was hot
i love to visit murrays for my bagel fix
the bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture both chewy yet not gummy
the decor is very simple but comfortable
we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included ceviche mix special crab dumplings assorted sashimi sushi and rolls two types of sake and the banana tempura
the owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic
for some reason all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the salmon
the dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet
best reuben sandwich ever
the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless so was the seafood tagliatelle
great bagels made the oldfashioned way
the design and atmosphere is just as good
i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin which was heavenly at sushi rose
it can not be the ambience because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle
not impressed with the food
when i saw that their website had a link to da ciro in napoli i knew there was going to be good pizza
the food was very expensive we spent 160 for lunch for two but extremely tasty
but the pizza is way to expensive
the plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom third generationfornini pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle again making it soggy and nothingon the rest
service was very good prompt attentive and nonintrusive
unique apppetizers
decor is nice though service can be spotty
as far as the service goes the waitresses were not particularly friendly but they got the job done
staffs are not that friendly but the taste covers all
the view is spectacular and the food is great
the price very reasonable
while the ambiance and atmosphere were great the food and service could have been a lot better
bottom line b for the food f for the service
you get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice
the tastes makes your mouth water for more
the secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered
we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu
i almost wanted to write a bad review so no one would ever go here and i could have all the dumplings to myself
we did have to wait at the bar for approx
try the crunchy tuna it is to die for
a gentleman maybe the manager came to our table and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order
they treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and wellprepared
i can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant
though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room no matter what the size of your party the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in
i would n't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy too
by far the best pizza in manhattan
the service however was a bright flower in a garden
believe us we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs
the chicken pot pie is excpetiona the cheeseburger huge and delictable and the service professional wan warm
if it is n't for the food a it must be the service or the ambience
all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better
i am amazed by the poor reviews i find this place to be standout italian in an area flooded with italian great prices great atmosphere good service and a wonderful wine list
the food was bland oily
love the atmosphere felt like i was in paris
service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded
the fries are yummy
great food at reasonable prices
the prices are wonderfully low
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out
really though where's the seasoning
the website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing
ive been here so many times the waiters know my name
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned
other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced the atmosphere is filled with energy and the beautiful people of course and the food was surprising good
the food is mostly made from scratch fresh and well prepared
i like the ambience it's very dark and original
one would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks instead we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so
also specify if you like your food spicy its rather bland if you do n't
the antipasta was excellent especially the calamari as were the filling pasta mains
after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner
the service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy
we started with lox and mussels the best ive ever had ever and had the cod and trout for dinner
the food here does a great service to the name cantonese that is
although the tables may be closely situated the candlelight foodquality and service overcompensate
the staff is also attentive and friendly
and they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world
we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order
excellent lunch buffet for only 695
among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants this offers by far one of the best values for your money
prices are very good
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat
pizza here is consistently good
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee
service was on par but not wonderful
their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu
growing up in ny i have eaten my share of bagels
they are the best bagels i've had
i had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i've had at this price range
the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes
i ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil
for the people who want great food plus great service roxy is a place to avoid
the bagels are fabulous
we went to eat at the jekyll and hyde restaurant on friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food
the service is ok but could be better
over the years it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine
went on a 3 day oyster binge with fish bringing up the closing and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended because it was so great
hats off to the chef
do n't eat here unless you're starving for thai food and you work next door
food is average and i would say even the chain restaurant baluchi's tastes better
the place is a little tight and on a cold day the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily
still any quibbles about the bill were offset by the pouryourown measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house
the food always tastes fresh and served promptly
we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday and i was thoroughly impressed with the food
the dinner was ok nothing i would have again
i recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices
the pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down it was a pleasurable experience
the barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry
worse of all 60 was erroneously added to our 80 bill
my wife and i will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them as they tend to offer large portions
get the tuna of gari
oh yes and if you are a fan of indian oldies film stars there are plenty of portraits of indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls some of which i would love to know where they obtained
i would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar
the menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size
the food was just ok at least for what food was available
the food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring
the food arrived 20 minutes after i called cold and soggy
luckily we saved room for the bbq salmon sea bass and crispy duck
such nice people working here but i have to review the food
staff is very accomodating
the sandwiches are dry tasteless and way overpriced
but do n't ever order bacon late at nite either platter or in sandwiches for that matter do n't from any take out place as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos hurt my molars
had we been stalling i could understand where they were coming from but we had been there less than an hour and they had n't even brought us a check yet
the wine list is n't great and the desserts are shipped in from bruno's down the street which is not as good as it used to be
the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal
they do cater to american palates but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water
this place is always very crowded and popular
i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible
the waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away
we got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about
we walked in on a wednesday night and were seated promptly
if it's just a quick martini at the bar which i recommend jeffery's or a mind blowing roast chicken go to village
right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city
zero ambiance to boot
even after getting pushed out by the noclass famous ray's sal has risen again to carry on his father's uncle's legacies with a smile true love for his community and let's not forget the outstanding pizza
i had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table
great food great decor great service
but nothing stands out about the cooking
you can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience but for superb food at reasonable prices la villa ca n't be beat
this place however has a lot less pretension than joya and the thai food is still above average
kind attentive wait staff
the svc can be a bit rude at times esp if you have big group but overall the restaurant is a must
we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks
i particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries
i do n't like indian food too much and this was delicious however you want to factor that into the equation
the highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries i received from one of the food runners which is not good considering the bill was nearly 100
meanwhile the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil gratis
ambience is so cute and quaint good for business although we were there on vacation
after my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer
the people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud
make reservations but expect to be delayed 1520 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square
the thali was small thoroughly unremarkable and 1495
the food is spectacular from the appitizers to the main course and then of course the desserts wow you'll need no more
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well
spice is great thai food love the inexpensive appetizers
we had reservations at 9pm but was not seated until 1015pm
the only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar
its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal relax be able to talk and have a very good time
not a large place but it's cute and cozy
uni from maine vs california sea vs freshwater eel to get a good taste comparison
the wine and cheese plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling
the food's as good as ever
the food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible
for many people this may not seem like aunthentic thai food because most places in nyc arent quite authentic
i could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched so watch out
once they ran out of gnochi and made it for me from scratch
the food is reliable and the price is moderate
i like cafe noir dont get me wrong it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent
we love the food drinks and atmosphere
food was very good as well considering that we tried the budget selection though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer so that fat was more of a meltinyourmouth experience
if this happens just ask for real naan
i could n't reccommend their godmother pizza any higher
if you go to roth's try to be served by mike he is great
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights
you can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard
the ingredients taste fresher the crust is thinner and crispier the slice is less oily and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at joe's
joe's pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up
a very inviting restaurant with friendly service
the menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger to steak to escargot
for the location the prices are very reasonable
it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late raucus dinner
i complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted
decor leaves something to be desired
and the bill was outragous
also if you do n't want to sit at a certain table you do n't have to
though the service could be better possibly due to more than one very large group in the house it is very cordial and warm as is the general clientele
its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of new york
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away we had n't even looked at it yet we had full beers yet to drink the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations
while the prices are nothing special the portions are huge
beef noodle soup is good as well
the vibe is very relaxed and cozy service was great and the food was excellent
the food was very good a great deal and the place its self was great
great bagels spreads and a good place to hang out in
decor is minimalist and clean nothing to distract or commend
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll
cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most
this place is worth going even if only for their beer
it's all about the food
in summereat outside on a terrace another great feature of suan
the real kicker of the menu however is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass
really cool stauff inside
i am happy i did the food was awsome
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city the food was not what i had hoped for
the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving mean while there were boths open all around
i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river seine
a restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere
his drinks are very inventive delicious and classy
the food was absolutely horrible
the owner truly caters to all your needs
did i mention the wine
admittedly this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate and thank goodness in my opinion but for simple elegant sushi there is no better place in new york or anywhere in the us
great food lt's of it more then one person can eat
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal
the fried rice is really good too
the wait staff is very freindly they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town
i would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time
food does n't appear to be cooked on premisis but there's a high turnover so its pretty fresh
the dim sum here is only soso
the sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable
this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it
they were such a ripoff 895 for four small meat patties in steamed buns and not worth trying
shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here simple contract deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20
i was n't there for the halfprice saturday night special but tuesday night
very affordable and excellent ambient
night without a reservation we had to wait at the bar for a little while but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience
the main course had an average portion and was decent overall
they do n't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai
i come from a family of pizzeria owners and i'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in fornino's blows my families receipies away
the bill is approximately 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks
the pizza is overpriced and soggy
a cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts
the crackling calamari salad which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants is crispy and lightly dressed
here's to the fake fish tanks too
this place is the most japanese it can ever get
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them
the red curry is weak and tasteless the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy the rice is often overcooked and the seafood is pretty sketchy
while we thoroughly enjoyed the food it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation
we had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning
the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines
the ambience is very calm and quiet
i found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying fresh and yummy
i've read some of the previews reviews people are either not new yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food
food was average and creme brulee was awful the sugar was charred not caramelized and smelled of kerosene
the rest of the dim sum though pricey by chinatown standards is worth it
you are paying for the atmosphere which is nice but can be had in numerous places in bay ridge
went there for an office lunch
she gets 10 for her excellent service and advice
the service is always bad though do n't expect much of anything from your server and i would not recommend bringing a date here either
if your favorite chinese food is general tao chicken then this is not your place
went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers
even if the food was n't this good the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax
my family and i ate here last night for our annual christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends outoftown
the restaurant was packed at first so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated
where tanks in other chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sadlooking marine life in their murky waters the tanks at ping's are clear as glass with healthylooking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch
the food was boring and expensive
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overated and on the pricey side
great romantic place for a date try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close
southern indian cuisine is still there too
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go
once for dinner and once for brunch
for the price you can not eat this well in manhattan
i grew up on these bagels
the service was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served
food was very good but not what i would consider out of this world
our waiter was fine the place looks nice in that nottryingtoohard way but at those prices a little more should be expected of your food
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation
i also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order
i care more about the food and ambience
the highly spiced chai tea was great too
their bagels are fine but they are a little overcooked and not really a' special' bagel experience
it might have been a little too spicy for my friend which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand
great for groups great for a date great for early brunch or a nightcap
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine if not good
went for a late weekday lunch
we ordered the special grilled branzino that was so infused with bone it was difficult to eat
on the other hand if you are not fooled easily you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with alain ducasse and food that will outshine in presentaion taste choice quality and quantity
the flavors are great and the menu is extensive
the food is ok but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and would n't miss roxy s food is expensive but it's new york
i found it on a cold night the perfect spot to warm up
yeah shanghai is also great but not quite as good they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out
the only positive was the wait staff which was prompt knowledgable and likeable
the atmosphere is n't the greatest but i suppose that's how they keep the prices down
i've waited over one hour for food
i recommend their pad see ew pork chops or tofu plates
the food is delicious
my husband said the portions were very small but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me
a cool bar with great food and tons of excellent beer
the atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistrotype vibe
no you're going to go back because the food was good
they did not have mayonnaise forgot our toast left out ingredients ie cheese in an omelet below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it
if you'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent long tan is a good place on the slope
i had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive
the miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past
try the chocolate mud cake warmed with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato
the food is great
i really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food
the service wine selection ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition
also the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday unexpected but a truly above and beyond thing to do
if you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare you'll love artisanal
the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions
20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality i even took a friend here from japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the us that he has been to
try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates
the people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak english their job is to give you the delicious food you point at
granted the space is smaller than most it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants
i would recommend roxy's for that but not for their food
one of my favorites though was the angry lobster a cold lobster salad that was magnificent
stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu though too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick
the eggplant parmesan is also great and my friend who grew up in manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce
word of advice save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu
i recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal
it's supertrendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence
a touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed
delicious food excellent service and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the 599 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch
the pickles were great addition
we actually left hungry and went across the street to wo hop at 15 mott street for some good chinese food
while the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made tiffin so attractive the menu has been overhauled
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant
quite frankly this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried
too bad the food was n't of the same heritage
for appetizers i recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings
dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time
the have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini
the best burger i have had in the village
try the lasagnette appetizer
good food at the restaurant a bit expensive but great if you want to impress your date
moderate prices
the spicy tuna and salmon are the best we've ever had
less wait time for me
i am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food but my friend who took me there is
the service is friendly if not the most prompt in the world the food is great and the prices while not cheap wo n't put your wallet out of commission
the service is ok some of the people did n't get what they asked for
the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan
cornelia street looks like a broadway set for west side story and the inside of po is so cool quaint you really ca n't top the setting for a romantic dinner in nyc
good drink
my husband and i enjoy sangria
the staff is excellent specjal that girl behind the bar european chic
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff because despite the current one this is a great place
i do n't know about you guys but when i go somewhere to eat i go for the food not for the atmosphere
also top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu
all in all the food was above average and i would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners
coming from boston this place is like emma's pizza in kendall square in cambridge although they have more funky toppings
as soon as i wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how i will be getting to fried dumpling
the service was excellent the food was excellent but the entire experience was very cool
even though i made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through dinnerbroker we were seated at a table with one of the best view
top spot in town for vietnamese classics better than places that cost a lot more
i'm no food critic but i'd like to think i have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in ny for the last 11 years
for years i thought tuscan cuisine was the best but salvatore converted me to the hearty neapolitan fare on my first visit
in terms of the food itself nothing special we limited ourselves to several appetizers
we also had shared a house salad that was fresh
you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert
the food is definitely good but i left a bit disappointed
the food was not fresh the sauces were bland and very oily
the service was mediocre and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal
a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner
but the thai is definitely not great bland and indistinguished
the entire dining experience was wonderful
when we sat we got great and fast service
we parked on the block of nina's the place looked nice with people obviously enjoying their pizzas
it appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows
the ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service
compared to essa tal offers a less doughy bagel
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce
and you ca n't beat the prices
apparently the good cook works then
the staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table
this place has the best interior i have seen anywhere in the northside of w'burg and will impress whoever you bring there
the food was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny
may the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you
chance is a small cozy restaurant with a romantic feel to it the decor is great
it's a shame that a nice convenient place like the pink pony can be so ruined by lousy service
a narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters a great deal of mess stacks of bottles cans and a small counter holding 1214 entrees
i would recommend reservations on weekends though
the only concern i have is with the slighly allbusiness waitstaff who order and throw the food down rushing you out
the filet mignon dish was superb
the place was n't too hard to find but it was kind of packed as soon as my boyfriend and i got our food the line reached the door
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day
whenever you need a sushi fix mizu will be there with quality fish and great service
try the pad seew or chicken with cashew nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience
forget the rush and the wait and the noise which is n't actually that bad i mean please who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic
grilled whole fish wonderful great spicing
service was very good and warm
it's simply the best meal in nyc
excellent dumplings served amid clean chic decor
the menu has lots of options i hope to go back to try those potato pancakes
decent wine selection too
then get ripped on free box wine
overall a solid restaurant and at less than 40pp including wine a solid deal as well
it is set far from the small street it's on and there is no traffic noise
he takes real pride in his food and his business
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great
food was okay nothing great
the menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked
each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface and you get platters of thin sliced meats various vegetables and rice and glass noodles
if you can handle that it's a great place for a business dinner fun with friends or simply a table for 2
the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced
only wine and beer are served but the house varities are actually quite good
the food is decent at best and the ambience well it's a matter of opinion some may consider it to be a sweet thing i thought it was just annoying
all my coworkers were amazed at how small the dish was
the entree was bland and small dessert was not inspired
these innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible
the service was impeccable and unobtrusive the staff knows what they are there to do to know their menu present your meal and attend to your needs
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance
for the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated
the food at this place is'gourmet' indian cuisine
the plain slice is great and if you get toppings the whole slice is topped with them not sparsely sprinkled on like some places
the food is great and authentic
i have been here a few times for dinner once for brunch and twice for lunch
he was terribly thirsty after the meal too
we were looking forward to nice glass of sangria when we arrived
the atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon
the table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry i understood they were busy
the entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt
this is n't your corner chinese food takeout
have the iced tea
service was devine oysters where a sensual as they come and the price ca n't be beat
in an effort to increase turnover the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse
well this place is so ghetto its not even funny
service was warm and attentive beef carpaachio was exellent huge portion and pasta was fresh and wellprepared
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent
try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh a delicious and sweet tasting bread
the steak is good the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great
i had the salmon dish and while it was fine for the price paid i expected it to have some type of flavor
we asked to be moved which took half an hour and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back even though the rest of the room was practically empty
we all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews i felt there was more than enough food
while i quite liked the food and the ambience i'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window
service is not exactly five star but thats not really a big deal
i would just ask for no oil next time
great spot whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner
no dress codes no attitudes plenty of comfort companionship a great place to relax in an always busy midtown
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere
this is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive
the food was very good but not very thai
this was my frist time at cafe st bart's and i must say how delicous the food and the service was
its worth the wait though
they used shredded cheese on top
the most annoying thing though is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food
well their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold
would n't recomend it for dinner
i grew up eating dosa and have yet to find a place in ny to satisfy my taste buds
and the staff is also young energeic and hot
other guests enjoyed pizza santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way
the meat dishes were only soso
if you are in a big group this place is perfect because it recomends sharing they have lazy susans on most tables even families can feel comfortable here
i was very impressed by this lowkey upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine
we had a girls' night dinner here for restaurant week
the food's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate truly embracing the beauty of authentic thai cuisine
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4 which makes no sense whatsoever
i must say it's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view
but that was n't the icing on the cake a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had
overall the ingredients and technique are there and i am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant the food
it is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere
frankly when you compare what you can have here for lunch versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city there is no comparison
the corned beef and pastrami are excellent much less fatty than those big tourist places around times square
the main downside to the place is the nazilike guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level
the food was amazing and the service was prompt and helpful but not overbearing or rushed
price no more than a jersey deli but way better
the food was actually aweful
the fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt
i went here with a friend on a whim we went someplace else first and could n't get a table
nice atmosphere the service was very pleasant and the desert was good
stick to dimsum not super overpriced noodles
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money
there is a downside if you're ordering in the delivery guys have major attitude
we shared a bottle of sake an order of edamames and she had the sushi plate while i had the sashimi
i've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste
the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent
this place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of japanese classic cuisine
the appetizers are just ok and the main courses were decidedly subpar
while the 20 entree range is not overly expensive in new york city there is definitely better food in that range and so sapphire despite it's lovely atmosphere will most likely not be a restaurant to which i will return
brick oven gallery is my pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere
oh and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough yummy
great for large groups and celebrations our super happy waiter was the entertainment of the evening
definite go if you're used to good indian restaurant food from abroad
and their prices are very high they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service
i went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and did n't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait
if you're looking for a great meal at a decent price go to del frisco's
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods indian included i made friends with this place long ago
it's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner
when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets and then ordered for them
my wife and i went to orsay for valentine's dinner
the setting is casual and romantic
great bar most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen specifically the blond lady
the food was really good i had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever
barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist as if poached yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning a spice rub might have overwhelmed however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance
the jukebox plays everything from italian opera to the strokes
the place was real empty but that was because this was the first sunday they ever opened
one of the best chicken tikka masala
the food was soso
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it
their whitefish salad is excellent all whitefish with a little mayo
the crust is thin the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly
160 for 2 filets 2 sides an appetizer and drinks
i liked the beer selection
the dim sum was soso but not spectacular
i had the best ravioli ever
the decor in this place is very dinerish and the kind of place you expect in the east village not romantic just simple small and sparse
the fried dumplings are great
always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one
i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi on saffron risotto yum
quality of food is excellent and price is cheap stick to pork fish chicken lamb and vegetables
incredibly poor service an food quality at exorbitant prices
i wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill
for great chinese food nearby you have wu liang ye and grand sichuan just a block away
we had great desserts including the best cannoli i've ever had and then they offered an after dinner drink on the house
the music is the best among all the indian restaurants i have visited
service was very friendly
this food is asianair fusion
the food however is what one might expect
the prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the west village
the food was spicy and delicious
the waitstaff are all very busy it's not outstanding service but i've never been dealt with rudely
good fast service
the sake menu should not be overlooked
the flavors robust and subtle
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty
the restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible reaching for sunglasses
we ran a little late for the reservation but it was n't a problem to get our table immediately
their calzones are horrific bad vomitinducing yuck
average to good thai food but terrible delivery
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food
an excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but the food was slightly disappointing
please if your thinking about it go and stay the wait you wo n't be disappointed
i've had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times when i have been in the neighborhood
it saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy crowded bar at dinnertime
i would definitely go back for a very special occasion but not for regular fine dining
try the times square cocktail ginger lemonade with vodka also available without vodka
will have to return to try the chocolate
the service varys from day to day sometimes they're very nice and sometimes not
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city
the tables are crammed way too close the menu is typical of any italian restaurant and the wine list is simply overpriced
the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting the additional menu items are only written in chinese
highly recommended is the spicy fried clam rolls and spider rolls
after a seafood craving i checked citysearch and chose to go to fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info
they've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods
the food is okay and the prices here are mediocre
the sushi was awful
they did give a 15 discount at the end was n't enough as they knew the service was horrible
the staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check
my fiance took me to scopa last week for my birthday and i could n't believe the food
we usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty
the staff was knowledgeable and full of personality
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves
looking around i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently
bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar
authentic pakistani food
service was efficient courteous
i recommend the jelly fish drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings certainly the stir fry blue crab
best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous
we always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied
we actually gave 10 tip which we have never done despite mediocre food and service because we felt totally ripped off
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap
my suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other dishes
the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back
the' kamasutra' and' bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time
what makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in nyc that offers authentic chongqing hotpot
the waitresses are nice also you can just get counter service sit
i had a terrific meal and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good
i love and i know gourmet food by excellence
we were seated promptly as we had reservations however after that the service was slow
killer sushi
for two people with tip was less than 25 bucks
the food is good but very expensive for the casualness of it
everything from the soft bread soggy salad and 50 minute wait time with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food
this place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing
we ordered the chicken casserole but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken all dark meat and on the bone
the restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must
the photobook menu was a cute touch certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken pork chop and noodle dishes that we all ordered
i have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary
it is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner
my turkey burger was not cooked at all my friends salmon was completely raw
again the waitress was awesome
great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work
until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service
after complaining about the chicken dish the manager came over to tell us that no one had ever complained before and that we just did n't know what the dish was supposed to taste like
it's also attached to angel's share which is a cool more romantic bar
the location is perfect
dessert ca n't be missed so save room
always popular always full always a wait
the waitstaff were attentive polite and helpful an impressive feat in such close quarters
my husband and i have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar chef yoshi and ordered everything ala carte
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute
i have been to spice three times twice during lunch and once at dinner
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine
fine dining restaurant quality
the food is wonderful tasty and filling and the service is professional and friendly
the waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished
we laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip which was generous i feel
everything looks great the drinks the decor the food even the people
check out the secret back room
has the chef and owner changed
great wine list italian good food service was initially fine
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian
in fact while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu and i could n't help telling them that the food was horrible
i ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks
waitstaff is great very attentive
i had the tuna tartare with sake mushroom ravioli with pinot noir and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for 49
patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff
the service was attentive yet discreet
if you are someone who appreciates simplicity elegance and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size kai is your place
not sure where the previous reviewer lonk dined but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food
we were in search of food and stumbled on this block of indian restaurants on east sixth street
overall the best bagel in town
the pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza
do n't expect to sit down inside though there are only a few tables and they are always full
i recommend the garlic shrimp okra bindi and anything with lamb
all the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that i have had in the city
from the incredible food to the warm atmosphere to the friendly service this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat
if you go for the pretheatre menu it's an even greater deal
nha trang while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables
restaurant snobs need not bother this is a small neighborhood kind of place
the waitress remembers me and is very friendly she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd
when you're sitting in their main dining room which has a spectacular handpainted high ceiling you'd never know there was a world outside
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere delightfully free of the bts
after we got our sashimi order i could not believe how small the portions were
i have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme and this chef accomplishes without fats
after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner
we saw them heating up at least one frozen item though i'm not sure which dim sum dish it was
sake collection was excellent try nanbu bijin but pricy
the service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura
fresh ingredients and everything is made to order
ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding
the food was pretty good but a little flavorless and the portions very small including dessert
the banana tower is an amazing dessert as well
the pad thai lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but i've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places
the wait staff is pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeous in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way not in that she'swaycuterthanmethatb way
aside from the sea urchin the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail boton shrimp blue fin torro fatty tuna sea eel etc
we ordered a tuna melt it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich
try ordering from the regular menu then you would not regret
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else
yes there might be a wait if you have no reservations
plus on wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited
i've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer
everything is always cooked to perfection the service is excellent the decor cool and understated
we were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional
a bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks
this is the only thai place i go too in nyc it's wonderful and live relaxed jazz on certain nights
tasty steak pork loin the works
we went around 930 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree
i did n't take a look at the rest menu but the oysters were fantastic
we did n't even see a menu as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes
oh do n't even let me start with how expensive the bills were
we were on our way back to nj and since i am in ny we figured why not grab some food
just straight up cheap good food
the food is very good too but for the most part it's just regular food nothing special
definitely not worth the price
prices are in line
the menu is prix fixe so be prepared to spend at least 60 per person but it is well worth itsuperb food
i ca n't wait for summer when they serve outside on their gigantic patio
i would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space
priced at upper intermediate range
try the pad thai it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant
i recommend the thai popcorn
the staff is very kind and well trained they're fast they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations
the noise level was unbearable conversation impossible
food awesome
the all you can eat deal is truly amazing here
excellent atmosphere delicious dishes good and friendly service
the food was good
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations
even though the restaurant was packed we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems
thr at moshphere is compact modern yet cozy
appetizers are somewhere around 7 each and the main dishes are between 11 and 16
if i wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers i'd go out in manhattan
faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery
my husband had the mesclun salmon and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses
my friends and i experienced amazing cheese and a delicious new summer menu at artisanal last night
the wine list is also really nice
you have to increase the service a lot
it's a nice place to relax and have conversation
the selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available
thius is a must for anyone who loves shabushabu
there are much better places in ny with better prices
three courses choices include excellent mussels puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world
i have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things the heavy black antiqueseeming teapot for one in the restaurant experience
however if you want great food at a great price and do n't mind the decor you ca n't beat this place
the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like
i stumbled upon this second floor walkup two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from la being serious sushi lovers we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action
this was n't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup but i thought that was what made the place so special
i have eaten a lot of pizza here
still stay away the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer
highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service
our tiny table for two dinner plates hung over edge was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic
the sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect
unfortunately the food was not something to get worked up about
delicious crab cakes too
yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they'd treat us well for the occasion
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone
we could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue
the specials are usually quite good too
the waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal
the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out a romantic date or a special occassion
we had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great
the fried rice is amazing here
lived in shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship green bo restaurant there
dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet
the best part of the experience was knowing that the manager a bubbly friendly young woman with a great smile truly cared about how we were doing
the fish was adequate but inexpertly sliced
they are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch
the freshest best variety and the fastest delivery
anyways if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food i would n't waste my time trying to find something rather go across the street to tamari
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded
great eats good times
i love indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it
good dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch
meat dishes now adorn the selections although there's still a large number of vegetarianfriendly choices
service is friendly prices are good delivery time was a little slow but for the way this pizza tastes i'm willing to overlook it
as we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were
the italian food has flavor that can be sort of surprising on the ues and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive they sort of remind me of the ny yankees of the late 90's no matter how bad it look you knew that there was a rally just around the corner
just because it's cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty it is great
the staff ignored my friends and i the entire time we were there
they did n't give us the dinner special until we asked for it
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace
i am not sure if i would call the food here indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be french with an indian or exotic touch
it only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table but standing up was n't too bad
leon is an east village gem casual but hip with well prepared basic french bistro fare good specials a warm and lively atmosphere
toons has recently been redone so it's now a very attractive space
have frequented'ino for several years and the food remains excellent
at the end you're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup
the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal but some dishes are quite good such as the eggplant parmesan veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca
for all of you new to indian food try the paneer roll it is a piece of heaven
the food is yummy especially their cookedtoperfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries
they pray to their food gods to make them into a good pizza like vt's
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer
i went to df for valentines day dinner
always great service
the big complaint no toasting available
the wine selection by the glass and bottle is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town
obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys
the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice
we a menu that rearely changes e xcept for one or two specials the quality and care they put in thier food in evident
i do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant
fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapenolime olive oil the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness
haru serves very fresh fish has a trendy modern ambiance prime location on park avenue south and friendly service
service was also very good
despite the fact that the space is large they've overcrowded the floor with tables
i had the pad thai and the noodles were sticky
from an english speaking staff
scalina fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining
decent thai food in cute though a bit dank little nolita hangout but service terrible
not only is the cuisine the best around the service has always been attentive and charming
they have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody
our server was very helpful and friendly
the makhani was ok the korma was bland
fresh authentic french cuisine in substantial portions
what came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy
the second you walk through the heavy vault like door with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime
i love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine even with no idea how to use them
while most people can attest to spending over 50 on drinks in new york bars and hardly feeling a thing the drinks here are plentiful and unique
do n't waste money on decor
they have authentic indian at amazin prices
i am not a vegetarian but almost all the dishes were great
the service is outstanding and my crabcake eggs benedict could not have been better
my goodness everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing
the corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth
and even with it's pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches
found service above average but that could be because we were 13 of us
food is great
try the tandoori salmon
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive
instead of wasting your time here support restaurants that care about food
someone else recommended the dessert we also left that
the waitress seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing
they showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt
their sushi kamikaze and other rolls are fresh and well presented
first of all this place is not romantic as claimed by citysearch's editorial review
the owner is very friendly and a great guy go try his pizza you'll like it
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale
so if you want a nice enjoyable meal at montparnasse go early for the pretheater prixfixe
even the pasta is delicious here a rarity in new york pizza restaurants
the combination of fresh tomato sauce fresh mozz cheese basil and the dough they make with imported flour makes this is one of the better pizza's in ny
the chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry inedible chicken with terrible sauce
okay service
i got the 10 10piece dim sum combo every bite of which was great
the food was terrific and the service classy attentive without being overbearing
for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato with espresso which were tasty but i thought a bit overpriced
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in quite a weird selection
the service was poor restaurant poorly lit staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald's than this joint
over the years the host vittorio and his crew have always treated me as family although with all the business this notsolittle gem does it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but notsofrequent visitor
this is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for takeout pizza
i have been a longtime fan of holy basil in the east village and while i do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality i have been hesitant to be disloyal
both the fresh mozzerella slices and the plain cheese slice are phenomenal
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another
with so many good restaurants on the uws i do n't need overpriced food absurdly arrogant waitstaff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner clumsy service and management that does n't care
given the incredible architecture surrounding it this place has no character
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it
best italian food i ever had and being italian that means alot
no one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates
as for the bar this is another bad idea
the food is outstanding and the service is quick friendly and very professional
great food good size menu great service and an unpretensious setting
save your money and do n't waste your calories go to margharita's on washington street instead they have amazing food and the best service
unlike hh up the block this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for
the food came out wrong the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal
i was with a party of 7 close but not next the the front doors and we were eating with our coats on
during the course of the past 3 months the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better
if you're looking for a place to sit down have a drink and conversations with friends go to sweetntart and order yourself a hongkong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls hot
you will pay a lot for the decore but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other chinese and asian fusion places in ny
i choose to go with one of the special the braised lamb shank in red wine which was excellent
the wine is always good the tapas are always yummy especially with the warm pita bread
the prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety serving almost 40 of items bbqed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with notsofresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance
for dinner i had the chicken tikkamasala and some garlic naan
the service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals
ummm the beer was cold
good spreads great beverage selections and bagels really tasty
we recently decided to try this location and to our delight they have outdoor seating perfect since i had my yorkie with me
still try it once since if you end up loving the food it could be one of your best dining experiences
however in the summer of 2003 it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup
the service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark
the food is uniformly exceptional with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating whether it's on the menu or not
the best pad thai i've ever had
yes they use fancy ingredients but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right
the food drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city
it is nearly impossible to get a table so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner do not pass it up
i did n't complain i liked the atmosphere so much
if you go here your focus should be the tamarind margaritas
i was backtoback with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again
try sushimi cucumber roll
there is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner
order the panang duck it's fantastic
baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices
just stick with the small dishes
joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful if not relaxed atmosphere
the grilled cheese at home afterwards was better
if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here
the wait here is long for dim sum but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig this is a sleek for chinatown alternative
drinks way over priced
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food this is one of the best spots
people are always friendly
a great choice at any cost and a great deal
otherwise good stuff for late nite eats
this is some really good inexpensive sushi
no free drink
the portion sizes here are huge and the sushi is good
upon entering we were greeted by the owners steven and frederick who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me
but when you are seated the waitresses are great they explain everything on the menu and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get
it took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer
however their popularity has yet to slow down and i still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation
we ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin
the portions are huge so it might be good to order three things to split rather than one appetizer and entree per person for two people
especially liked chicken tikka and the naan and the dals
otherwise this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere
we were disappointed with the prefixe menu of only 2 choices per course other restaurants offer 3 choices and ended up ordering a la carte
because we did n't have a reservation we could only sit in the back garden but it was great secluded and perfect in nice weather
i love their thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must
i have known about this secret for the last 13 years emilio the godfather has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices
the food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive considering we were the only ones there for the first hour
this place is a great stop for great food
the service is awful the last time i was there and i do mean the last time we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers
our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine
not a typical pizza joint but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner
the beverages were excellent and the dessert was good
the menu changed portions were even smaller than before a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility a basmati rice dish lacked flavor
bill a little high but worth it
waiters tend to forget drinks completely food portions are so tiny two people have trouble sharing one entree
they came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant
the service is good and the resturant is clean
the establishment scores big points in presentation and style
we had pam's special fried fish and it was amazing
be sure to try the seasonal and always delicious specials
the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic
the food is good i ca n't lie
i did n't expect to like nosh as much as i did but the pastrami on challah sandwich i had was otherworldly the soups are like mom's and the knishes give yonah schimmel's a run for its money
just bring someone who speaks cantonese because waiter may not understand you
the steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty
but they were too big for the bun
the food was undercooked the sauce watery and the vegetables raw
good bagels and good cream cheese
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other
could be pricey without a prix fixe meal
they charge different prices all the time
the only thing the waiters do n't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave
if you want some roast duck pork or chicken on rice with ginger try them out
wo n't or ca n't is not in the service directory
but after last night spice grill is the only place i'm eating indian cuisine
he offers subpar service and has no personality
consistently good japanese tapas
this is a great thai restaurant with a very friendly staff
the sauces used are also not that exciting
when going out for a nice dinner i like a nice ambiance as well as very good food
bagels are ok but be sure not to make any special requests
the rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats
the first time the sushi was outstanding the second time it was a little bland
we were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a sunday night
tell them herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter
the staff has been nice but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often
it is also extremely well priced
while the staff at this little bistro is very friendly i have never experienced more incompetency
you rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys masaman green red are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it
the waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food
love the jazz bands on fri and sat
every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st taj mahal is also very comparable in food quality to the much overpraised and underdeserving baluchi's
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money
his wife tanya the hostess completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious
i've dined at alain ducasse's restaurant in monte carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience
the seafood is amazing there's a good wine list and the everchanging menu always offers some great surprises
we got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter
we did notice however that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan
the seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here
to celebrate a birthday three of us went to mare anticipating great food
the counter service is bad
my friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great
by far this is the only chinese desserts place i know in ny or anywhere close in the northeastern america that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar
orsay is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic french food in nyc
the dishes offered were unique very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages sardines with biscuits large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream the best and freshest i've ever had
dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks swirl them around and eat
i had lobster bisque it has 2 oz of maine lobster in it
the price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh
try the hot dogs too they're snappy and delicious
guacamoleshrimp appetizer was really great we both had the filet very good did n't much like the frites that came with but the filet was so good neither of us cared
i was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there
i ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked thai flavors in unexpected ways
the buffet had a nice selection
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime
and forget what you read under me the atmosphere is n't that bad either
try green curry with vegetables
the sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great
go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience
anyway the food is good the price is right and they have a decent wine list
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective
the pad thai is excellent here as well
the decor is dark cool and soothing while the food's presentation is spectacular considering the low prices
but who says murray's is anything about service
deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area
all i can say is 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you'll find in the city though the quality is some of the best
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end
the hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale
while we enjoyed the food we were highly disappointed by the poor service waiter was not quite competent and slow service and lack of remorse
decor is nice and minimalist food simple yet very well presented and cooked and the wine list matches the food very well
the food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to
planet thailand has always been a hit with me i go there usually for the sushi which is great the thai food is excellent too
my coworkers had to wait almost an hour for delivery only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered
whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite
there's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter
they are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service
it's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic even
aside from the rushed service we were very impressed with the food and the drinks
their coffee is quite good too
the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent
the food itself was just ok nothing spectacular but the service was awful
service is highly refined our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress
i work nearby and they have the best oatmeal in the neighborhood not a packaged or quickcooked item
i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty could've used a bit more salt
the other night we had the 30 three course meal and everything was delicious if i could of licked the plate clean i would of
service was very prompt but slightly rushed
stuffing yourself with japanese food is a rare thing
we were worried we would have trouble getting in but somehow managed to have a short wait
i loved the shows
total hipsterwannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot
deep fried skewers are good and still rare to find in nyc
we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic
the fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty
friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with
if anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines please check their wine list
the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing
i had the mango chicken and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful
the decor is really blah and not at all hip or happening
however go for the ambience and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world
the menu may be small but everything on it is delicious
though the spider roll may look like a challenge to eat with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll it is well worth the price you pay for them
the service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but i have never been treated rudely
have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners
despite a slightly limited menu everything prepared is done to perfection ultra fresh and a work of food art
the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive
great wine selection gigondas is worth the price and the house champagne is a great value
you get what you pay for and with that logic in mind spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting
the service was typical shortorder dinner type
at 5 dumplings for 1 you just can not go wrong
please try the filet mignon its just the most tender piece ever
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal
i would highly recommend nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures
the food portions are really large
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested
the bread is the soft paratha bread unlike the plain bread they use in calcutta and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful
the food was delicious the atmosphere was relaxed and we have now adopted plate 347 as our secret on second
now if they could only get a toaster
the prix fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough both in quantity and quality
i am a 100 lb girl had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner and i was still hungry after my visit to this place
note that they do not serve beer you must bring your own
even better they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it
good luck getting a table
no refills on fountain drinks though
i noted it was crossed off on the bill
if you're craving for haru's great food especially the house roll but ca n't stand the wait building outisde head across the street to their sake bar
not worth the prices
next time we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks
a large is 20 and toppings are about 3 each
service was good and food is wonderful
i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes they're that good
while the food was good certainly no il mulino the service was horrendous
sushi was n't anything spectacular for the price
its a goto for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests
an oasis of refinement food though somewhat uneven often reaches the pinnacles of new american fine cuisine chef's passion and kitchen's precise execution is most evident in the fish dishes and soups
the decor is nice but more casual than fine dining
service is fast and friendly
the service is awful
the pizza is good though
if you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share kai may not be the best option
if presentation and service is your thing then this magic show works
three of us arrived for dinner about 530 on a week night without reservations
terrible terrible management deserves to be shutdown
it's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend
the cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables but the service could have been better
from the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed
had a late night dinner on a saturday night
the well mannered pleasant staff that tony has in his employ
the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines
the staff has always been friendly without seeming grating and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions
super friendly and knowledgable staff fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz the chilaquiles were awesome
we were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 800 pm curtain call
unlike other places in nyc where the sandwiches you want only come as a tripledecker here you can get what you want in a reasonablysized portion and price
they charge 600 for rice
all the food was hot tasty
food was delivered by a busboy not waiter we got no cheese offered for the pasta our water and wine glasses remained empty our entire meal when we would have easily spent another 20 on wine
i do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer
after all that they complained to me about the small tip
we had the potstickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great
the lox is always fresh too
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation
the place was quiet and delightful
the last time i went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen
lahore is a great place to duck into latenight when you need some really tasty food on the cheap you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for four dollars
the menu is nothing like the one on the website
the staff is courteous and friendly
service is extraordinary yet not overbearing and the decor brings a taste of trendy soho into queens
try the green curry
the burger was great also
service friendly and attentive
most of the servers are very attentive friendly and quite attractive
my gf and i still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails the chill decor and the decent sushi
service has always been friendly and efficient
odd for ave b not just odd the place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least
last time i went here the waitress did n't come back after taking our order
the palak paneer was standard and i was not a fan of the malai kofta
taj mahal offeres gret value and great food
i've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious
no gimmicks here the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation
one should not go to lucky strike for the food
they need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent
my picks are scallion pancake fried with vegetable juice very special and tasty guizhou chicken shredded squid family style one of my personal favorites sichuan spicy soft shell crab shuizhu fish this one is for hardcore sichuan food fans i would n't recommend to my american friends as it's very spicy
it took half an hour to get our check which was perfect since we could sit have drinks and talk
the food served in small tasting portions as an option is very good with each dish being better than the next
the first time i went and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere i ordered the lobster cobb salad
usually 3 vs 4 items per dish
service is top notch
same owner as the guy who owns typhoon which is just down the street on st marks and 1st ave
le pere pinard has a 15 pretheater menu that is outstanding
the photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods
my steak au poivre was one of the worst i've had
best of all is the warm vibe the owner is super friendly and service is fast
very popular style izakaya sake and small portion of sakefriendly dishes
while this is a pretty place in that overly cute french way the food was insultingly horrible
made my dining experience uncomfortable
however it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth
service was decent but not as smooth as i would expect from a place with these prices and reputation
after the main course came we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 minutes
their eggplant is so delicate sweet tender
our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal
our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese
two words free wine
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me
it was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool
they never brought us complimentary noodles ignored repeated requests for sugar and threw our dishes on the table
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan
we visited bread bar during january restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service
the service is spotty sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there
do not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste
the crispy chicken was n't for us though
the food was just ok i would never go back
we would like to thank marcelo and grace for a wonderful dining experience
from the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just fantastic
try the sea bass
the bagels always warm soft on the inside crispy on the outside and enormous in size
we there were four of us arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
the ambience was so fun and the prices were great on top of the fact that the food was really tasty
it is the best deal in town for a monday night dinner at a fine restaurant
it is run by the same sichuan chef who started the chain in chinatown
jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot in the bronx
wine list is not huge but def well selected
the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere
the sandwhiches are outofthis world
if you do n't mind presliced low quality fish unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place
we had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for
we ate out in the back patio which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there
it's the perfect restaurant for ny life style it got cool design awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar
all the food was excellent considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes
the sushi is average and the prices are anything but
the staff has always been attentive and kind and i've always been amazed at how they've handled all the various different group sizes that come in
not too crazy about their sake martini
one thing i liked about this place is that i never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests
pizza and garlic knots are great as well i order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick
great service great food
but the main hit was the whole grilled fish
yes the prices are high but i felt it was worth it
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location
wow over 100 beers to choose from
the staff there is very attentive and down to earth
my boyfriend and i recently had an early dinner at artisanal and was satisfied with our experience
ask for usha the nicest bartender in manhattan
we could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time amazing we just sat down
i just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money
i usually go there later at night when i get off work so i do n't have to deal with crowds or lines
i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded
stick to the gulab jamun
yet paired with such rude service would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there
we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry
i ordered a chicken teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry
the food is delicious from the specials to the regular menufare the dishes are never a disappointment
he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine
the singapore mai fun had no curry flavor whatsoever
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent
just got back from lunch at tamarind and it was excellent
i have tried to make reservations but both times the hostess did n't have my name
we made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed reminds me of my grandfather its old school italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire
overall i'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again its chinatown
the 300 bill was a bit steep but the experience was great
pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods
they also have a back garden open in the summer cute and french with outdoor seating what more could you ask for
the bagel was huge
food was ok fish was cooked well
the red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside
quick and friendly service
get your food to go find a bench and kick back with a plate of dumplings
my host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered but some other items that were not ordered
service was quick
went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers
we've only eaten in the restaurant once but we have ordered many times for dinner
my biggest complaint was the untasty food although presented well
the thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy
but when we looked at the menu there were n't a lot of choices most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section
light refreshing summer rolls not fried remind me of vietnamese places in paris
the pizza is delicious they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap frozen shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's
and the tom kha soup was pathetic
each bite of food at kai was indeed delicious fresh and elegant
my entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid and was unnecessarily heated with a burner
veal parmigana better than patsy's
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place
the parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed
it's like they took leftover chicken poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it the sauce was translucent and red
normally that would be improper however they were all delicious and my host did not complain
this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time
the staff is accomodating the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed and the food is out of this world
metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal
winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you
the food is great and reasonably priced
if you live in upper manhattan siam square is the place for thia food
if your visiting you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in time sq
service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money
this place is not worth the prices
the food was just awful atrocious actually
the food is nothing like its menu description
also good for client lunch meetings esp
i ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor
pizza is terrific as is homemade pasta
the food options rule
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service which was boarderline rude
i've been to several places for dim sum and this has got to be the worst
i really recommend the very simple unda egg rolls
get the soup and a nosh pastrami sandwich for 8 and you're golden
the food is great service is ok
the halibut was too salty dessert was so so do n't waste any of your calories and service was poor
the service was attentive
they sell special sushi everything have a topping sauce and etc
the staff was very attentive the ambience lovely and the food superb
fast service
the food was well prepared and the service impecable
the appetizing is excellent just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price if bought by the pound
the steak tartare is a great bet they fix it for you at the table
the wine list is extensive and impressive
the takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes i ca n't wait
the menu consisted of standard brassiere food better then places like balthazar etc
there are other people waiting
great indian food and the service is incredible
if you are looking for a good quality cheap eats this is the place
you can get an excellent meal at most of the many indian restaurants on nearby lexington avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here
first the wrong bread came out with the appetizer then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course
to begin we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready
our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats
after dinner take your date to the huge dance floor probably one of the biggest you'll see in ny
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window
it can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order but once the food is ordered you are in for a treat
when you want a piece of beef head on over
try the cheesecake
what an amazing meal and experience
more important the sushi rivals the best in tokyo
by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant
taxan delicious
the place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh
very good service and very good prices
kalbi and nebbiolo do work together
the zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth
i love the atmorphere peep
my husband and i both ordered the steak medium
do n't dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes they are simply not up to par with the nonveg selections
delicate spices onions eggs and a kickass roti
complimentary stuff kept coming and when the waiter saw me opening a gift i received my dessert on a plate that had happy birthday written on it with a candlevery nice touch and attentive staff
behind this counter two men are squeezed in
we all ate pasta entre'es which were great
try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel
the food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri sevpuri and samosa chaats as well as other great indian appetizers
their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under 30
pizza the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings the crust tastes like the best freshly baked bread
there was a great deal for 6 blue point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for 8
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date
we were seated and ignored by waitstaff
as a longtime patron of mamoun's i always figured that i had found the best late night food spot in the city
while the place is not a hotspot hangout the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck
pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high ask for extra rye bread
the food is terrible and overall i would have to say avoid at all costs
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment
their sake martini is wonderful
while certain staples are excellent the burger some of the pastas the food is not really the point
every course was better than the next
the menu looked good except for offering the chilean sea bass but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood
from beginning appetizers the scallops were incredible to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet we were delighted by the taste sensations
a cheap eat for nyc but not for dosa
if you've ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer
interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole
i had their eggs benedict for brunch which were the worst in my entire life i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was
this is the perfect spot for meeting friends having lunch dinner pretheatre or aftertheatre drinks
several of the dim sum orders had about 68 pieces
there are a few italian employees who may not speak the best english but for me that adds to the experience
i understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters you come for the authentic foods the tastes the experiance
all conveniently delivered right to the door
the mussaman curry that i ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that i ordered in it they graciously provided me with one piece of poorly cooked potato
we had a wonderful meal at naples 45 a month ago on a visit to nyc
from the terrible service to the bland food not to mention the unaccommodating managers the overall experience was horrible
i found the food to be outstanding particulary the salmon dish i had
if the weather is nice try to snag an outside table
the first 2 courses were very good but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet
there is usually a wait but it is well worth it
there was no ambiance
the food was below average the service was pathetic there was no ambience at all
very good wine choices
you can also special order any kind of dumpling etc
this is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together
the prices can not be beat for the quality quantity freshness and taste
the food is a diamond in rough the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes
ive been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before and toons is by far the best thai food ive had except for my mom's of course
the rice to fish ration was also good they did n't try to overpack the rice
the signs the specials menus food and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese
frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side
but they do n't have a toaster which is strange
the noodle and rices dishes taste great
the flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive nothing flashy
we did n't get drink refills and she did n't even offer us the option of dessert
there was a long wait for a table outside but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice
since my first dinner i have had the chance to have brunch at orsay 3x
tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes
the sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp
the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes however be warned that the peter's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top like a salad
they had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice result we had large chunks of burnt rice in our serving bowl
this restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced
all in all this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city
simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions
the atmosphere is unheralded the service impecible and the food magnificant
i guess the way my friends and i described it was the french colonies
by the time we were done it was past 100am
molto bene
this is a fun restaurant to go to
also the place is popular with families so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals come later at night to avoid them
the frankenstein show was the best
old school meets new world
you ca n't go wrong with this place
give it a try and enjoy
try everything for that matter it is all good
bravo blue hill
skip baroanda down the street eurotrashy snooty and expensive and check this place out
not someplace i would seek to try out but if i am in the area again i will certainly stop by
it's a small cute restaurant
i came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since
avoid this place
they outshine hh
it's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone
everyone i have spoken too there is super friendly helpful and willing to the extra mile for a customer
a word to the wise the hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is the cleanest restaurant in town
in fact it appears he is going to go postal at any moment
this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed
bleecker st pizza is the best
ps please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there
would definitely visit again
they brought glasses and the bottle and just left the bottle at our table
we have lived in chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant
i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband
there's nice and quiet small but enough for 6 or more
another great place to take outoftowners
highly recommended
we were very disappointed
nothing against a good sales call but the tactics at amma are just too obvious
the only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to roth's is the strip house
after dining at bog over twenty times now its official
the perfect spot
i definitely will go back
at first i was rolling my ideas of yet another french place on the ues
sure everyone's got their favorite but to know sal is to know new york
i have never had anything like it
slightly on the pricey side but worth it
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you
not a great place for family or general dining
my entire family was horrified
it is the best hidden spot there and i rave about it to everyone
we thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like
okay so i never write but there does n't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning green bo and it's time to speak up i live in chinatown
i recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady
recommendations of course are required
it's delicious
the most fun restaurant i have ever been too
you can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation
this place was not all that
i try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited
it is thick and slightly soggy
i went here in the afternoon with a friend
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one
i absolutely loved this place
this was a great surprise
overall i would recommend it and go back again
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning
chinese desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness
this place is great
i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends and spent three enjoyable hours there
my husbands was perfect my was well done and dry
we were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant
they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior
romantic if you want it to be brightly lit
filled with suits though so you never really feel terribly comfortable
ahhh
this place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the prospect expressway and greenwood cemetery a wasteland we like to call the sliv
i found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons
terrible experience
it's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early
lloovve this place
i go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed
tasty but expensive
i'd definitely recommend this little place
i've never been disappointed
on a monthly basis my friends and i get together and have a girls night out
will not be back
as many other reviewers noticed your order is often slow to arrive this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time
we try frequenting new restaurants all over the city but any time that we visit a restaurant other than roth's we are always disappointed
have recommended the place to friends always gets good response
you'll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city and most still do n't compare
i recommend it
but i just would like to say i read the reviews people left and thats why i checked it out
i am bringing my whole family back next time
it's very spicy but not offensive
just remember the later you go the longer you may have to wait
kudos to po
this is my favorite italian restaurant in all of new york city
i can not recommend og more highly if i tried check it out for yourself
if just to drop in quickly stuff yourself and jet out to keep their turnover
i highly recommend the sophia pizza
really
so close but not good enough
all i can say is wow
would recommend perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central
for park avenue i expected so much more
anyway this is the last time i cross the williamsburg
rao is a good restaurant but it's nothing special
this is a great place to take outoftowners and perfect for watching the sunset
we come from new jersey to eat at kinoko
you fellas above says its the best taiwanese restaurant in town
and i have been around the block to say the very least
at first i was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of nyc
amma has the worst value for money i have experienced in nyc over the past 2 years
the problem is just thatit is a sometimes kind of affair
it's convenient
this is the best thing in soho
we always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune
just awsome
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth
i was pleasantly suprised
i asked for them spicy and they were delicious
got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full
i had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of
the best i've found outside of the chinatown masters
when i'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office i head for cafe st bart's
again if you are in this neighborhood by all means come here
please do n't fool us
for meetball night
never once did i leave feeling unwelcome or impressed
for an untrendy ripoff eat here
i have never been disappointed in the red eye
compared to other shabu restaurants around town this places wins handsdown
i will be returning
if you like sakagura but you feel it's too much you'd better try yokocho
i live on the street this place is on
i love going there
it is terrific as is the value
i had a great experience
i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood
we have tried every thai restaurant between atlantic avenue and 4th streets and joya is the best
it's better than being on the roof of sutton place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night
will absolutely visit again
we love th pink pony
look i dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place please try someother places
all pretty good
will never be back
i think the restaurant was too loud when full to be romantic
they treat me like family morning and night
anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment
and cheap
to me it exemplifies soho cute artsy interesting
definitely worth the trip to battery park city
i absolutely love this place
anyhow we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat which was nice
i never had anything i did n't like here
my only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you
i agree
it will be on my to do list the next visit to nyc
i am completely hooked on this place it is ridiculous
look foward to trying the ruben upon returning
in any event even though its a bit on the pricey side we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back
we will return many times for this oasis in midtown
i loved it and would highly recommend
stay away from the latter since you wo n't go for seconds hint hint
it just was n't thai
my husband and i ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokenicom
they are amazing
we just ate at kai and were disapointed
this restaurant is such a great place
i have been in many restaurants all over the city and roth's steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites
bring your appetites
i just do not understand what the fuss is all about
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary
during happy hour
on a recent sunday afternoon a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt
do n't be fooled by crowds of people
dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty indian restaurant in the upper east side
you guys rock
despite the untasteful previous review
i have been doing all of the above at the heartland brewery for over 5 years now and i have never been disappointed
i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews
ok for all of us growing up in the village of nyc we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants most of which stay open very late
go hungry and enjoy
went with mommy the only person who could afford taking me here
do n't judge this place prima facie you have to try it to believe it a home away from home for the literate heart
cute and decorative
do n't go
oh right i should probably say something nice
excellent experience
i'm from england and haru's was the best i had in nyc
this is definitely a place that provides the best experience though to both alisters and people walking in off the street
highly highly highly recommended
faan is sooo good
never fails to please
if you are a vegetarian this really is n't a good place to go
definately check it out
nice place though
ou must try this restaurant
he always says i do n't have customers
go to any corned indian restaurant and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme
do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe's to eat here
we all felt it was worth it
we were n't even at our table for more than an hour total
however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town
she lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy
definitely will be back
when we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years
guess the 555soul ads did n't launch her big modeling career
i am so coming back here again as much as i can
if celebrities make you sweat then your in for a ride but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype
david daytona beach fl
village is one of those places that scores on all fronts
i drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at scores
overall excellent restaurant
this place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area
i was very disappointed with this restaurant
what a ripoff
this is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret
this was one of the best restaurants i've ever been to
i'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much
i have tried literally every restaurant on curry row
pricey but worth a try at least once
overall a worthwhile experience
needless to say i'm never going back and you should be wary too
it's somewhere you can eat and be happy
for asian fusion there are many places further downtown
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets with that certain parisian flair
and we were thouroughly disapointed
this restaurant is not worth the time effort or money to say the least
have been several times and it never dissapoints
everyone i bring here always loves it
i've eaten at pizza gruppo a few times but more often i order delivery
we were not disappointed
it's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street
delicious
i'll be back soon
steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table
but that is highly forgivable
interior was so so
no apologies during restaurant week
we were n't
highly recommended for a first date
while it's not nobu it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full
i went to ruby foo's after work with a group of 6
finally a reliable chinese restaurant
i really liked this place
you'll adore it
our first greeting when we entered was the last call is at 1015
if you live outside the neighborhood do n't bother
but i would n't wan na live there
i have been to roth's twice and both times were very disappointing
problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable
i love this place
great experience overall
my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend
i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst
i would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion
we've lived in the area for more than 8 years
really depends on your luck
or sister in my case
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem
this place is always packed
and it was quick which is very important
amazing
not cheap but not that expensive either
off the beaten path this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street indian restaurants
i am going to the mid town location next
i loving bringing friends here and i do so every chance i get
i would go back tho
you will not be disapointed at all
i for one will never patronize them again
enough said
the catch is that you are charged extra for anything that you leave on your plate so do n't be a greedy pig
we will go back every time we are in the city
go with a group of friends and you will have a great time
this is probably one of my new favorite places
brava la pizza fresca
it could have been handled better
do n't go there
i've been several times and am totally smitten
great people watching as others do the same to you
everything is delicious though my gf and i come here once a week sometimes you will get addicted
from the street it looks very hidden and is actually an old warehouse
and affordable
it's true this place is not cheap
some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at jimmy's
this is the best shabushabu restaurant in the trystate area
a guaranteeed delight
we were pleasantly surprised
and i could do without the cigar smoke
you ca n't go wrong here
we'd go back again
it seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too
inside is a little cramped but to be expected
i've been to joya twice and i will never go again
worth a visit
it is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in bay ridge
i loved it and would go again
is just the way it was in days gone by
ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in
this lovely frenchasian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on smith street
i went to pams with my girlfriend and i love it
went inside and i started to get excited
you could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other french bistros
go here
everyone was more then happy with his choices
a little noise but i think that was because of our party
a hearty two thumbs up
what a great place
i am french and i really felt like home
it was tiny and i felt like i was eating in someone's living room
however it is jus too good to not praise it
definitely a neighborhood favorite
conveniently located too being right on bedford ave
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet where greasy dry and tasteless are complimentary
aside from the bearded courdoroy blazer professor type with the nyu student he's sleeping with that week you see a strange mix of hipsters frat boys will smith types who need to be told they are black bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet
this one is definintely my least favorite
if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave
do n't waste your time or money
i will definetly be going back
chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city
a great addition to smith street finally a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing ugg boots
i was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine and have been going back regularly ever since
no plans to return anytime soon
just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday
this is the first time citysearch did't call it right
i have been going there since it opened and i ca n't get enough
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place he painted the ballato's sign in the window
like others have said do n't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes a busy restaurant may require you to wait
i think this is one of the more underrated places in the city
eat club is a roving group of nyc gluttons
that said i thought scalini fedeli was one of the best dining experiences i've ever had
go here
what more can you ask for
i consider the best grand sichuan restaurant in nyc
tends to turn people away
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret
i have n't been to the other locations
very different than regular dimsum places
then if they answer the phone you're lucky if they do n't hang up on you
alone for 100 bucks it is really overprice
this is also where i was from
i think locals rate this place so high
all of it was simply amazing unique and tasty and best of all it did n't break the bank
i love essabagel but i live on the west side so i often go to murray's for convenience
it is expensive but well worth the money
that's why you have to pay more for that
i hate hate hate this place
always fresh and delicious
not worth it
less more in their case
also they were 15 each
great for a romantic evening or a fun evening with friends
i have been twice to this restaurant
this place which is only a few months old is perhaps queens' biggest secret
it helps if you know what to order
besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city
it was a very nice surprise
once you become a regular you are treated as one
get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago
i have to agree with the previous reviewer
there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me
stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and i will be going back frequently
it was huge delicious fresh and will be the reason we return
we spent 200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed
thanks bloom's for a lovely trip
you guys are awesome
none of that yucky whipped stuff
will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings
well worth the trip close to city hall and downtown subway stops
i've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed
i would definitely recommend mary's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts
wow how have i missed this one tried long tan last week for the first time and now know what the ny times and many more in the neighborhood already knew
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions
it was horrible
but too far east
everyone treats you like you were part of the family
this place is so much fun
if you were there when it first opened give this restaurant a second chance
three strikes and this restaurant is out
definitely highly not recommended
if you venture off the island of manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great italian restaurant drive to corona
murray wo n't do it
i can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there
i would go back
if you wrote a bad review it's because you do n't understand what rao's is all about
we will be back
sure enough exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly
wonderful at holiday time
this is where the aforementioned line was
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone
but they do
if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained this is a great place to go and eat
this is n't a value joint
all in all i do n't see how you can go wrong
going to ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen an absolute delight
i thought this place was totally overrated
avoid at all costs
always busy but fast moving
besides we were on vacation
i know you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends seeking a pleasant experience
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary
we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem
a big disappointment all around
everything about this restaurant was special
i take all my nyc guests to vt's
a defitely must visit
based on the reviews on here it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 pm
this should have been done in a back room away from customers
looking from the outside in one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall really that's what it is
i dont how this place is still running
but this place is a welloiled machine so they know what they're doing
but hey there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in astoria
you can do it here
we were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past
out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens this is among the best
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn
i ca n't wait to go back
we happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results
there is a real gallery of stars that have visited
once you step into cosette you're miraculously in a small offthebeaten path parisian bistro
stay far away from this place
it's to die for
the best place to bring kids or any friends who want to do something different
better than the bagel shop on the corner but not worth going out of your way for in my opinion
this is one of our alltime favorite
went to village last night for my birthday
suan has challenged this loyalty
i only have friends
it is not worth for that bucks
i do not recommend the heartland brewery
big thumbs up
this is the cheers of new york whether you've ever been there or not
we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night
a pleasant surprise
go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby veal calf ok bad joke but you will see
but i'd go back
i hate this
i have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one
beautiful experience
too bad latin quarters closed
somewhat pricey but what the heck
i'll keep this short
if you do n't mind all that noise then go to the chart house
this place is to be avoided
i love this place more and more everytime i go
there is not a single place in chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here
where gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat
if that's a problem go to mcdonald's and destroy your insides
it's a really great deal considering we got full off of four dollars
do n't look down your nose at me like that
i just do n't understand all the hype
my girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite
i'm glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny
while i'm not sure that this happens all the timethis is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business
i would definently recommend this restaurant
they even scoop it out nice for those on a diet not too much not to little
something about them being busy with holiday party's
definitely not a restaurant to skip
they never came back to refill our glasses again
that's good and bad
rosario's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence
if you are a carnivore come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been
was there friday night
a million better places to go in the city
they also do a great job for restaurant week
i knew upon visiting nyc that i wanted to try an orginal deli
restaurant was dirty and unkempt
i would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again
it was wonderful
i am indian and i have tried many indian places in ny
so eat fast and order a lot
perfect for dates
so garantuan that you ca n't fit them in a toaster
i've been eating at taj mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the indian eateries on this block of indian restaurants
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side
tuk tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in brooklyn
this restaurant was way overhyped
this is the jackel and hideof the restaurants on the ues
they're terrific
and there's no way out
we generally like good restaurants and eat out often but kai was way to expensive for what we got
first of all dal bukhara rocks
for my birthday and we had an excellent time
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent
when you enter you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen
i'm sure i'll return for a final judgement tho
he ca n't help they're bought up so fast
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end not one person takes responsibility for anything
i highly recommend it
this restaurant used to be pretty decent
fantastic place
we had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant
ca n't wait wait for my next visit
i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken
having hunted around for a quiet romantic yet not hideously expensive restaurant i stumbled across reviews for la lanterna and gave it a shot
go for it
i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time
unbelievable
this was the perfect quiet relaxing and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian
when i arrived at orsay i was thrown back in a veyr good sense
worth the trip from manhattan
the place does get crowded so i recommend going between 45 pm
if your into thaiyou can not miss this great restaurant
we were very pleasantly surprised
i would highly recommend it
want to impress
horrible
it is by far my favorite restaurant in brooklyn
however for what we spent overall it just was not up to par
we had a good time
i thought i had died and gone to heaven
boy was i wrong
now at the top of our list del frisco's steakhouse
plenty of choices to make your own creation
in china the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud
i go twice a month
i came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend
i love it
they were dry and disgusting i did n't even finish my first piece
i love the place
and all of that wo n't break your bank
for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves
try it side by side and there's no comparison
i would not recommend this place to anyone
not the typical nyc gimmick theme restaurant
finally
bon appettite
me and my girls will definitely go back
skip this location and go to the one in soho
to speak of the park side words can not describe
when i visited my friend who lives in the upper eastside she recommended that we go to this restaurant
i would go again if i did n't have to pay
you will find yourself returning quite often
however it's not worth a special trip
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising
how do you rate home
i went there with my friend last saturday
raga's is a romantic cozy restaurant
my friends and i came across this place while walking in the village
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list
we bring in a party of ten or so every week
i heartily recommend
in any event this is a place i'll be sure to stop by again when i'm in this part of town
being from the south there are n't any good delis in my area and while watching foods across america on pbs i found out about katz's deli
obviously run by folks who know a pie
i seriously doubt i will ever dine at jimmy's bronx or for that matter jimmy's uptown again
jimmy is dominican
would never go back there
searching to get out from the cold freezing weather we went into what we thought was a deli
i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try
thank you emilio
everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends
but on a lazy saturday night we ended up going
our friends have not arrived yet
as a retired hipster i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laidback late night in the city
it's a steal
it's usually packed for good reason esp
one of my favorite places in manhattan
everything at sala thai is tasty and wellportioned
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night
we will definitely go back
oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant arties cafe
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine
not only would i not recommend jimmy's restaurants to friends i would strongly suggest they go anywhere but
i'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud
please save yourself the frustration
go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else
my husband and i thougt it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary and to our surprise it was fantastic
so if yo really do n't care who is sittingnext to you which is about 2 inches away i would say try it
however i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you or with the local union worker on the other side
for all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to alphabet city i say good stay out
most people eat there seem to be typical upper east side snobs so be aware
i had been searching really hard for a restaurant in new york where i could really feel unwanted and ignored and i finally found it
i liked this place the first time but doubt i will ever return
for myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion i do prefer smaller quiter restaurants
now it's so crowded and loud you ca n't even talk to the person next to you
always full with tourists especially because of it's close proximity to rockefeller center
its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car i happen to live in inwood
stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting
i'm saving up for my next visit
just ignore the trendy wannabes
even my indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was
as a fan of thai i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst
great neighborhood joint
fantastic
i would highly recommend this place
a real dissapointment
love yuka
for some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening i do n't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area
and i've been to many nyc delis
i've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences
this time i prefer not to go into detail
people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans
you are treated just like royality
i am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort
i will go back to suan soon
it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york
go go hurry before everyone finds out about it
went there last night for 2 year anniversery and was n't all that impressed
this place is cool enough to be in the east village but french enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in paris
i will have to say this bengali fast food joint is clearly my favorite
even though it is a little loud you do n't have to yell at each other to talk
amma is nothing special
loved it
for outoftowners who will get a big thrill out of the location
my mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant
if only they delivered they'd make a mint
heartland brewery is a great way to start or finish your day
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family
just do n't do it
please be aware that it's cash or amex only
i've been living in the columbia university area for about 10 years with 3 kids now in their teens
i wish they would change back to what it was before
you will be satisfied
it is simply amazing
however it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street
obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong it actually means great prosperity
by dinner time they turn it around and mount a huge comeback
trust me it will be great and all of it will be devoured in no time
the characters really make for an enjoyable experience
they are fast
we go often
have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience
i read the other review and have to say i had the opposite experience here last sunday
i came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged
i live a block away and go to patsy's frequently
i pray it stays open forever
one of the more authentic shanghainese restaurants in the us definitely the best in manhattan chinatown
i live in the neightborhood and am a regular
this is by far my favorite restaurant in nyc and i only wish it were more affordable so i could go more often
this is my fourth try over a two year period and i'm done
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke
we were then shooed inside
you wo n't find that anywhere in manhattan
my boyfriend and i have been to the minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed
go only if you are already in the neighborhood and do n't want to bother going farther for a better place
one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood
we have been to montparnasse many times and return often for good reason
they're rude at times and not very friendly
they do n't concern much of customer's health just want to make money
no thanks
i definitely would n't go back
went here last night and had a pleasant experience
we left never to return
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there
i've been to at cafe spice probably 58 times it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square
in the evening this place attracted a well dressed with it ny crowd
this was on a tuesday night
after the review i treked into brooklyn
enjoy
that place was awesome sally
we went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments
satisfying
everything we had was pretty good but we have only been there once
there was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at pastis
i brought some buddies from ca and they loved it
my six year old loved it
we spent 50 definetly will come back with my friends
when we stumbled on leon we thought that we had found quite the gem but we were certainly wrong
if you want to save some money do n't go here
highly recommended
i've lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all
my girlfiends and i ate at og again last night
yeah it's that good
it was pretty inexpensive too
tuk tuk is my second favorite neighborhood thai place the first being joya
what a great place
so sorry i ca n't rate this better
wonderful
to dine at thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside its so bland on the inside
i have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night
so i thought why not change it up a bit
it's one of our favorite places to eat in ny
when we arrived at 600 pm the restaurant was practically empty
it's really a takeaway place i would n't sit if i could take it home
i have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in ny and hooked a few new yorkers onto peep as well
this place is a great bargain
i know this is the case in many nyc eateries but here they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable
we do not need to go to a fourstar restaurant anymore
this thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from sripraphai another delicious thai restaurant
heartland brewery is by far one of the best places in nyc to make new friends and catch up with old ones
haru on park s is simply disgusting
but warning to all those that use this site be weary be very weary of recommendations
la rosa is connected by a swinging door to the mexican restaurant pacifico
maybe tomorrow
do n't leave without trying one night in tokyo
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store
so again give it a try
when i called this morning i did n't think i would be able to get in at 12 but i was able to get in along with four other guests
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are
not pretentious and very economical
we would return to this place again
i ca n't wait for the nex time
worth it for a special occasion or any time
it is loud hot and dark
definitely a once a year treat that i look forward to around the holidays
it is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet go late and it will be packed
i in all reality felt as if i had just gotten off air france and was in the 8th district in paris
i was there on sat
at 630 we were the third party there
they live up to the thai way of living
just wish they'd expand
for 600 the most we have ever paid not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance
hurley's is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came
they all know you
we got most of it back at home with us
with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district is truly an excellent find
wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment
i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood
on a recent saturday night i was with a group of 5 at the bread bar
if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde
katz's has been a nyc original for over 100 years
authentic bistro
based on a visit a month ago i returned the week before christmas and was hugely disappointed
also because it is so thin it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling
katz's deli is a great ny experience
place should also have a 123 chili rating to be more authentic
this place is amazingly bad
our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy
we picked it randomly without a recommendation from someone who has been there so we were n't sure what to expect
hmmm
i know because i live nearby
i love this cozy around the way rest
a friend from seattle and i went on a thursday night around 830
yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously but it should n't
overall worht every penny
great idea and base for restaurant but work on the details people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like
go inside and you wo n't want to leave
i went with my fiance on a tuesday evening
also very inexpensive
i've always been seated propmtly
everytime my husband and i go there we are never disappointed
look elsewhere
perhaps it was an off night but it was suprisingly average for a 93 rating
this place is a literal holeinthewall that is buried within doyers right off of pell st barber's alley in chinatown
get there before 7pm
you can not go wrong at the red eye grill
get over it
ruby foo's is a tourist trap
go girls
so my husband made up an excuse so we can leave
i loved this place
it is very overpriced and not very tasty
to give you an idea of how good we thought it was we ended up going to ping's three weekends in a row
a one women show
i am a die hard peep lover
a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite
walkins are risky too
i've been many time and have never been disappointed
it was divine melts in your mouth
i got enough reasons to keep coming back
when we left at 800 pm it was packed and noisy
moral stay away
in fact you ca n't miss it
i was at rao's last wed
there is nothing more pleasant than that
the only thing i could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table
i would n't mind going back some time but not before trying others nearby
i went to amma after a friend recommended it
it's true you feel like your in a scene from goodfellas
very neighborhoody very quick and sufficient
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices
for being number 1 this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation
i will be going back and heartily recommend it
take a good sense of humor an american express card with no limit walk out with a lollipop gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road
bravissimo
i have eaten at shabu tatsu at least 5 times and i always want to go back for more
i do n't think i would go again
i've ordered from the 2nd ave
i've been there a few times and i usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people
this place is worth an onehour drive
i went here with my boyfriend and another couple
everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date
went last thursday
chance is a joke
great find
and you're hungry a few hours later
having been a long time essabagel fan i was surpised to find myself return time and time again to murray's
came here for restaurant week did n't save much but it was still great
my wife and i were in nyc celebrating our 30th anniversary
i've been frequenting the tasting room since it first arrived in the east village and i've never been disappointed
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently
i plan on eating here more often
we went to ino for valentines
this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood
as a japanese native i've lived in the tristate area for over 8 years but i was just so amazed at this place
i have eaten here a handful of times for no reason besides sheer convenience
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistencynot too fishy creamy and slightly buttery
hurley's is terrific
the place is a lot of fun
i have never eaten in the restaurant however upon reading the reviews i got take out last week
recommended
mizu is the japenese find in grammercy
i wish they had one near my office i would go everyday
however i do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant
i do n't get it what's so special about prune
one less manhattanite the better
judging from previous posts this used to be a good place but not any longer
